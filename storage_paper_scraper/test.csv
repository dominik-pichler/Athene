38369615,Sensitivity and specificity of LDBio Aspergillus ICT lateral flow assay for diagnosing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in adult asthmatics.,2024-02-19,"Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgG estimation is crucial for diagnosing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). A point-of-care LDBio immunochromatographic lateral flow assay (LFA) had 0%-90% sensitivity to detect IgG/IgM antibodies against A. fumigatus.
To assess the accuracy of LDBio-LFA in diagnosing ABPA, using the modified ISHAM-ABPA working group criteria as the reference standard. The secondary objective was to compare the diagnostic performance between LDBio-LFA and A. fumigatus-specific IgG (cut-offs, 27 and 40 mgA/L), using a multidisciplinary team (blinded to A. fumigatus-IgG and LDBio-LFA results) diagnosis of ABPA as the reference standard.
We prospectively enrolled adult subjects with asthma and ABPA. We performed the LDBio-LFA per the manufacturer's recommendations. We used the commercially available automated fluorescent enzyme immunoassay for measuring serum A. fumigatus-specific IgG. We used the same serum sample to perform both index tests. The tests were performed by technicians blinded to the results of other tests and clinical diagnoses.
We included 123 asthmatic and 166 ABPA subjects, with a mean ± SD age of 37.4 ± 14.4 years. Bronchiectasis and high-attenuation mucus were seen in 93.6% (146/156) and 24.3% (38/156) of the ABPA subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of LDBio-LFA in diagnosing ABPA were 84.9% and 82.9%, respectively. The sensitivity of serum A. fumigatus-specific IgG ≥27 mgA/L was 13% better than LDBio-LFA, with no difference in specificity. There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between LDBio-LFA and serum A. fumigatus-IgG ≥40 mgA/L.
LDBio-LFA is a valuable test for diagnosing ABPA. However, a negative test should be confirmed using an enzyme immunoassay.","LDBio-LFA is a valuable test for diagnosing ABPA.

38369457,"Assessment of the association between health problems and cooking fuel type, and barriers towards clean cooking among rural household people in Bangladesh.",2024-02-19,"In low- and middle-income countries, households mainly use solid fuels like wood, charcoal, dung, agricultural residues, and coal for cooking. This poses significant public health concerns due to the emission of harmful particles and gases. To address these issues and support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopting cleaner cooking fuels like electricity and gas are acknowledged as a viable solution. However, access to these cleaner fuels is limited, especially in rural areas.
This study conducted a face-to-face survey with 1240 individuals in rural Bangladesh to explore the link between health issues and cooking fuel type, as well as barriers to transitioning to clean cooking. Using a convenient sampling technique across four divisions/regions, the survey gathered socio-demographic and health data, along with information on clean cooking barriers through a semi-structured questionnaire. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were then employed to identify significant associations between cooking fuel type and health problems.
The study revealed that a majority of participants (73.3%) relied on solid fuel for cooking. The use of solid fuel was significantly correlated with factors such as lower education levels, reduced family income, location of residence, and the experience of health issues such as cough, chest pressure while breathing, eye discomfort, diabetes, asthma, and allergies. Economic challenges emerged as the foremost obstacle to the adoption of clean cooking, accompanied by other contributing factors.
The use of solid fuel in rural Bangladeshi households poses substantial health risks, correlating with respiratory, eye, cardiovascular, and metabolic issues. Lower education and income levels, along with specific residential locations, were associated with higher solid fuel usage. Economic challenges emerged as the primary obstacle to adopting clean cooking practices. These findings emphasize the need for implementing strategies to promote clean cooking, address barriers, and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal targets for health and sustainable energy access in Bangladesh.","The use of solid fuel in rural Bangladeshi households poses substantial health risks, correlating with respiratory, eye, cardiovascular, and metabolic issues.

38369256,Assessing Meaningful Change in the Asthma Impairment and Risk Questionnaire.,2024-02-19,"The Asthma Impairment and Risk Questionnaire (AIRQ) is a 10-item, yes/no, equally weighted control tool. Lower scores indicate better control. Seven impairment items reflect prior 2-week symptoms, and three risk items assess prior 12-month exacerbations. The Follow-up AIRQ for use between annual assessments has a 3-month recall period for exacerbation items.
To evaluate the responsiveness of the AIRQ over time and identify a minimal important difference (MID).
AIRQ longitudinal study data were analyzed from patients with asthma aged ≥12 years. Anchor-based methods assessed differences in AIRQ scores relative to Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), the accepted MIDs for St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Asthma Control Test (ACT), and exacerbation occurrence over 12 months. Baseline and 12-month data reflected 12-month recall AIRQ scores; Follow-up AIRQ scores were utilized for 3-, 6-, and 9-month analyses.
1070 patients were included. PGIC ""much improved"" was associated with AIRQ mean score changes from baseline to months 3, 6, 9, and 12 of -2.0, -1.9, -1.9, and -1.8, respectively. Mean AIRQ score change among patients who met the SGRQ MID (≥4-point decrease) was -1.8 at 6 and 12 months. AIRQ mean scores decreased from baseline by -2.2 to -2.5 points at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 for patients who met the ACT MID (≥3 point increase). A 2-point higher baseline AIRQ score was associated with a 1.7 odds ratio of 12-month exacerbation occurrence (95% CI 1.53-1.89).

38369009,Characterization and applicability of a novel physiologically relevant 3D-tetraculture bronchial model for in vitro assessment of respiratory sensitization.,2024-02-19,"Chemical Respiratory Allergy (CRA) is triggered after exposure to Low Molecular Weight (LMW) sensitizers and manifests clinically as asthma and rhinitis. From a risk/toxicity assessment point of view, there are few methods, none of them validated, for evaluating the respiratory sensitization potential of chemicals once the in vivo-based models usually employed for inhalation toxicity addressment do not comprise allergenicity endpoints specifically. Based on that, we developed, characterized, and evaluated the applicability of a 3D-tetraculture airway model reconstructed with bronchial epithelial, fibroblasts, endothelial and monocytic cell lines. Moreover, we exposed the tissue to maleic anhydride (MA) aerosols to challenge the model and subsequently assessed inflammatory and functional aspects of the tissue. The reconstructed tissue presented phenotypic biomarkers compatible with human bronchial epithelium, and MA aerosol exposure triggered an increased IL-8 and IL-6 production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and apoptosis of epithelial cells. Besides, augmented IL-8 production by monocytic cells was also found, correlating with dendritic cell activation within the co-culture model after MA exposure. Our results demonstrated that the 3D-tetraculture bronchial model presents hallmarks related to human airways' structure and function. Additionally, exposure to a respiratory sensitizer induced inflammatory and functional alterations in the reconstructed tissue, rendering it a valuable tool for exploring the mechanistic framework of chemically induced respiratory sensitization.",,"[{'lastname': 'da Silva', 'firstname': 'Artur Christian Garcia', 'initials': 'ACG', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In vitro Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, GO, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Mendonça', 'firstname': 'Izadora Caroline Furtado', 'initials': 'ICF', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In vitro Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, GO, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Valadares', 'firstname': 'Marize Campos', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In vitro Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, GO, Brazil.

38367551,Subpopulations of children with multiple chronic health outcomes in relation to chemical exposures in the ECHO-PATHWAYS consortium.,2024-02-18,"A multimorbidity-focused approach may reflect common etiologic mechanisms and lead to better targeting of etiologic agents for broadly impactful public health interventions. Our aim was to identify clusters of chronic obesity-related, neurodevelopmental, and respiratory outcomes in children, and to examine associations between cluster membership and widely prevalent chemical exposures to demonstrate our epidemiologic approach. Early to middle childhood outcome data collected 2011-2022 for 1092 children were harmonized across the ECHO-PATHWAYS consortium of 3 prospective pregnancy cohorts in six U.S. cities. 15 outcomes included age 4-9 BMI, cognitive and behavioral assessment scores, speech problems, and learning disabilities, asthma, wheeze, and rhinitis. To form generalizable clusters across study sites, we performed k-means clustering on scaled residuals of each variable regressed on study site. Outcomes and demographic variables were summarized between resulting clusters. Logistic weighted quantile sum regressions with permutation test p-values associated odds of cluster membership with a mixture of 15 prenatal urinary phthalate metabolites in full-sample and sex-stratified models. Three clusters emerged, including a healthier Cluster 1 (n = 734) with low morbidity across outcomes; Cluster 2 (n = 192) with low IQ and higher levels of all outcomes, especially 0.4-1.8-standard deviation higher mean neurobehavioral outcomes; and Cluster 3 (n = 179) with the highest asthma (92 %), wheeze (53 %), and rhinitis (57 %) frequencies. We observed a significant positive, male-specific stratified association (odds ratio = 1.6; p = 0.01) between a phthalate mixture with high weights for MEP and MHPP and odds of membership in Cluster 3 versus Cluster 1. These results identified subpopulations of children with co-occurring elevated levels of BMI, neurodevelopmental, and respiratory outcomes that may reflect shared etiologic pathways.

38367463,Punicalagin from pomegranate ameliorates TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced inflammatory responses in HaCaT cells via regulation of SIRT1/STAT3 axis and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.,2024-02-18,"Punicalagin (PUN) was isolated from the peel of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), is a polyphenol with anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and antioxidant activities. However, it remains unclear whether PUN alleviates the inflammation and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in pro-inflammatory cytokines-induced human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Here, we investigated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) mixture-stimulated HaCaT cells were treated with various concentrations of PUN, followed by analyzed the expression of inflammation-related mediators and evaluate anti-inflammatory-related pathways. Our results demonstrated that PUN ≤ 100 μM did not reduce HaCaT cell viability, and PUN ≥ 3 μM was sufficient to decrease interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), CCL17 and CCL20 concentrations. We found that PUN ≥ 10 μM and ≥ 3 μM significantly increased sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression and inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, respectively. PUN downregulated inflammation-related proteins cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), enhanced nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Moreover, PUN decreased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and inhibited monocyte adhesion to inflamed HaCaT cells. PUN also suppressed inflammatory-related pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in TNF-α/IFN-γ- stimulated HaCat cells. Collectively, there is significant evidence that PUN has effective protective defenses against TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced skin inflammation by enhancing SIRT1 to mediate STAT3 and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",,"[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Wen-Chung', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Institute of Health Industry Technology, Research Center for Food and Cosmetic Safety, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan, ROC; Division of Allergy, Asthma, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan, ROC.'}, {'lastname': 'Liou', 'firstname': 'Chian-Jiun', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Allergy, Asthma, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Nursing, Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Research Center for Food and Cosmetic Safety, and Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan, ROC.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Szu-Chuan', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program of Nutrition Science, National Taiwan Normal University, 88 Ting-Chow Rd, Sec 4, Taipei 11677, Taiwan, ROC.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Sindy', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cosmetic Science, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Dermatology, Aesthetic Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC.'}, {'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Jane C-J', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'School of Nutrition and Health Sciences, College of Nutrition, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Chun-Hsun', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cosmetic Science, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Dermatology, Aesthetic Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Shu-Ju', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Aesthetic Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC.

38367422,Protopine ameliorates OVA-induced asthma through modulatingTLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis.,2024-02-18,"Chronic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness are characteristics of asthma. The isoquinoline alkaloid protopine (PRO) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, but its mechanism of action in asthma is not known.
Investigate the protective properties of PRO upon asthma and elucidate its mechanism.
The effects of PRO in asthma treatment were assessed by histology, biochemical analysis, and real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then, we integrated molecular docking, western blotting, cellular experiments, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence analysis, flow cytometry, and metabolomics analysis to reveal its mechanism.
In vivo, PRO therapy reduced the number of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, leukocytes, monocytes) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), ameliorated pathologic alterations in lung tissues, and inhibited secretion of IgG and histamine. Molecular docking showed that PRO could dock with the proteins of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, TAK1, IKKα, and TNF-α. Western blotting displayed that PRO inhibited the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. PRO regulated expression of the pyroptosis-related proteins NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, gasdermin D, caspase-1, and drove caspase-1 inactivation to affect inflammatory responses by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. In vitro, 24 h after treatment with PRO, cell activity, as well as levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, decreased significantly. Immunofluorescence staining showed that PRO decreased expression of TLR4 and MyD88 in vitro. PRO decreased nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Twenty-one potential biomarkers in serum were identified using metabolomics analysis, and they predominantly controlled the metabolism of phenylalanine, tryptophan, glucose, and sphingolipids.
PRO reduced OVA-induced asthma. The underlying mechanism was associated with the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis.",PRO reduced OVA-induced asthma.

Therapies for this potentially life-threatening condition are highly needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Omalizumab in food-allergic children.
This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Food allergic children with a cumulative threshold ≤443 mg food protein at DBPCFC were randomized to Omalizumab (asthma dose) or placebo (3:1). After 3 months, a second DBPCFC was performed (steps 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 mg food protein), followed by a separate open challenge up to 10,000 and 30,000 mg food protein if negative. Responders were defined as ≥2-step increases in threshold. Non-responders received high-dose Omalizumab. A third DBPCFC was performed after 6 months. Skin testing, blood samples, and the severity of atopic co-morbidity were registered during the study and 3 months after treatment.
In total, 20 children were evaluated at 3 months (14 Omalizumab, 6 placebo).

The aim of this study was to assess whether this association may be attributable to the child's own mental health disorders.
The study population included 15,092 twin children born 2002-2010 in Sweden. Questionnaire data at age 9 years was linked to national patient- and prescription registers. Maternal mental health during pregnancy and 3 years postnatally were identified from diagnosis and medication data (depression, anxiety and stress disorders). Atopic diseases in children were identified from questionnaires, diagnosis and medication data. Child mental health status (depression and anxiety) was identified from questionnaires. Three-way decomposition methods tested for mediation or interaction by child mental health disorders.
Maternal mental health disorders were associated with most child atopic diseases including asthma aRR1.36 (95% CI 1.12, 1.60), and child mental health disorders, aRR1.73 (95% CI 1.56, 1.92).

38366192,Escherichia coli CRISPR arrays from early life fecal samples preferentially target prophages.,2024-02-17,"CRISPR-Cas systems are defense mechanisms against phages and other nucleic acids that invade bacteria and archaea. In Escherichia coli, it is generally accepted that CRISPR-Cas systems are inactive in laboratory conditions due to a transcriptional repressor. In natural isolates, it has been shown that CRISPR arrays remain stable over the years and that most spacer targets (protospacers) remain unknown. Here, we re-examine CRISPR arrays in natural E. coli isolates and investigate viral and bacterial genomes for spacer targets using a bioinformatics approach coupled to a unique biological dataset. We first sequenced the CRISPR1 array of 1769 E. coli isolates from the fecal samples of 639 children obtained during their first year of life. We built a network with edges between isolates that reflect the number of shared spacers. The isolates grouped into 34 modules. A search for matching spacers in bacterial genomes showed that E. coli spacers almost exclusively target prophages. While we found instances of self-targeting spacers, those involving a prophage and a spacer within the same bacterial genome were rare. The extensive search for matching spacers also expanded the library of known E. coli protospacers to 60%. Altogether, these results suggest that E. coli's CRISPR-Cas is an anti-prophage system and highlight the importance of reconsidering the criteria use to deem CRISPR-Cas systems active.",,"[{'lastname': 'Dion', 'firstname': 'Moïra B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Département de biochimie, de microbiologie, et de bio-informatique, Faculté des sciences et de génie, Université Laval, Québec, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.\nGroupe de recherche en écologie buccale, Faculté de médecine dentaire, Université Laval, Québec, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Shiraz A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Ledreborg Alle 34, 2820, Gentofte, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Deng', 'firstname': 'Ling', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Food Science, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Thorsen', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Ledreborg Alle 34, 2820, Gentofte, Denmark.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.'}, {'lastname': 'Stokholm', 'firstname': 'Jakob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Ledreborg Alle 34, 2820, Gentofte, Denmark.\nFood Science, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Krogfelt', 'firstname': 'Karen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut, Artillerivej5, 2300S, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Schjørring', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut, Artillerivej5, 2300S, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Horvath', 'firstname': 'Philippe', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'IFF Danisco, Health & Biosciences, France, 86220 Dangé-Saint-Romain, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Allard', 'firstname': 'Antoine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Département de physique, de génie physique et d'optique, Université Laval, Québec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.\nCentre interdisciplinaire en modélisation mathématique, Université Laval, Québec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Nielsen', 'firstname': 'Dennis S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Food Science, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Petit', 'firstname': 'Marie-Agnès', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris-Saclay, INRAE, AgroParisTech, Institut Micalis, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Moineau', 'firstname': 'Sylvain', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Département de biochimie, de microbiologie, et de bio-informatique, Faculté des sciences et de génie, Université Laval, Québec, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.\nGroupe de recherche en écologie buccale, Faculté de médecine dentaire, Université Laval, Québec, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.\nFélix d'Hérelle Reference Center for Bacterial Viruses, Faculté de médecine dentaire, Université Laval, Québec, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.""}]"
38365985,A pilot study to assess the effects of preventing fluid retention in the legs by wearing compression stockings on overnight airway narrowing in mild asthma.,2024-02-17,"Nocturnal asthma is a sign of asthma worsening and could be partially due to more fluid drawn into the thorax during sleep by gravitational force and/or pharyngeal collapse in those with obstructive sleep apnea. Wearing compression stockings during the day reduces fluid shift from the legs to the neck overnight. However, the potential effect of wearing compression stockings to reduce fluid accumulation in the leg and to improve nocturnal small airway narrowing in patients with asthma has not been investigated. This study investigates whether reducing leg fluid volume by wearing compression stockings during the day would attenuate small airway narrowing in patients with asthma before and after sleep.
We enrolled 11 participants with asthma. All participants underwent overnight polysomnography with or without wearing compression stockings for 2 weeks. Before and after sleep, leg fluid volume (LFV) was measured by bioelectrical impedance, and airway narrowing was primarily assessed by respiratory system resistance and reactance at 5 Hz (R5 and X5 respectively) using oscillometry.
After 2 weeks of wearing compression stockings, the LFV measured in the evening was reduced (∆ =  - 192.6 ± 248.3 ml, p = 0.02), and R5 and X5 improved (∆ =  - 0.7 ± 0.9 cmH

Asthma severity, dietary inflammatory status, and diet quality were assessed in a sample of 202 children with asthma (55.6% males, aged 5-18 years) attending a pediatric allergy outpatient clinic. Asthma severity was evaluated according to the Global Initiative for Asthma criteria and categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. The Children's Dietary Inflammatory Index (C-DII) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) were calculated based on information collected by the 24-h dietary recall method. Dietary quality was categorized as poor, moderate, or good diet according to HEI-2010.
The mean age of the participants was 9.6 ± 3.2 years. Children with severe asthma were younger on average (p < 0.05). Children with mild asthma had significantly higher fiber and iron intake than those with moderate asthma (p < 0.05). C-DII values did not differ significantly according to asthma severity (p > 0.05). Dietary quality was evaluated as moderate in 89.1% of the participants and also showed no difference based on asthma severity.

Asthma-specific PROMs have been developed to measure a wide array of disease characteristics, including symptoms, medication use, exacerbations, and impairments to emotional and physical function. Some PROMs also include spirometry or expand questions to overlap with rhinitis symptoms. Use of PROMs to understand asthma control is included in management guidelines, yet real-world evidence of their effectiveness in improving asthma care is still limited. These instruments may be less accurate in characterizing patients with poorly controlled asthma and have modest correlation with exacerbation risk. Two new PROMs are highlighted, the Asthma Impairment and Risk Questionnaire (AIRQ) as an instrument to assess asthma control which incorporates domains related to exacerbation risk and functional impairment, and the CompEx as a composite of daily diary reporting combined with exacerbation events as an early efficacy signal for interventional trials.
PROMs are fundamental to asthma assessment. Novel instruments may improve the detection of patients at-risk for poor outcomes and shorten the drug discovery pipeline.

Patients with a DT score ≥4 were referred to social work. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to compare NCCN DT results with clinical and sociodemographic variables. Statistical significance was P<.05.
In total, 1,795 NCCN DT results were included, with uterine (37.72%) being the most common disease site. Benign pathology was known prior to completion of the NCCN DT in 13.15% of patients. Most patients (71.75%) endorsed low levels of distress. Moderate/High levels of distress were reported by 28.25% of patients. Increasing levels of distress were significantly associated with younger age (P=.006), history of depression (P≤.001), status as a current smoker (P=.028), and history of asthma (P=.041). Knowledge of benign pathology was associated with low levels of distress (P=.002). Procedure type and disease site were not associated with distress.
More than one-fourth of postoperative patients in a gynecologic oncology practice reported moderate or high distress. Distress was highest among those with malignancy regardless of disease site or surgical intervention. Benign pathology correlated with decreased distress. Identified associations with distress provide opportunities for prevention, early intervention, and tailored counseling.",,"[{'lastname': 'Gross', 'firstname': 'Maya E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': '1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.'}, {'lastname': 'Sobecki', 'firstname': 'Janelle N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': '2Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Chan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': '3Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Menggang', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': '4Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, WI.'}, {'lastname': 'Wallace', 'firstname': 'Sumer K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': '2Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.'}]"
38364351,Ayurveda management of a patient having bronchial asthma and hemorrhoids- A case report.,2024-02-16,"Ayurveda is a holistic science that treats root cause of diseases. One disease can become a causative factor for another disease. This concept is fundamentally described as Nidanarthakar Vyadhi in Ayurveda. In the same way, treating causative diseases is helpful in managing another diseases. However, many published clinical trials on Ayurveda management of Bronchial asthma and Hemorrhoids exist. There is a dearth of published case reports or clinical trials showing an association between Arsha (hemorrhoids) and Shwasa (bronchial asthma). This case report gives important viewpoints about the role of hemorrhoids and its treatment in pathogenesis and treatment of bronchial asthma. This case report of a 38-year-old female patient known case of bronchial asthma who came to the OPD of Kayachikitsa Government Ayurved College and Hospital, Nagpur with complaints of cough with sputum, breathlessness, chest pain (on/off) for three years. The severity of these symptoms increased for three months. The patient was treated with conventional Shwasghna Chikitsa (treatment of bronchial asthma) for five days, but the response was unsatisfactory. After five days of Shwasghna treatment, the patient gave a history of hemorrhoids. Considering Nidanarthakar Roga (one disease can cause of another disease), treatment was planned. The treatment principle is the treatment of causative disease (Arsha). Hence, Arshoghna treatment was added. Significant increases in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), Sustained minimal inspiration (SMI), and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea scale (mMRC) were observed. The respiratory rate was also reduced from 28/min to 18/min. Improvement in the subjective and objective parameters of the patient was observed. The inclusion of Arsha treatment can be helpful in the management of Tamakshwas (Bronchial Asthma). The need for further research in this direction is warranted.",,"[{'lastname': 'Khobarkar', 'firstname': 'Punam', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Kayachikitsa, All India Institute of Ayurveda, New Delhi, India; Kayachikitsa, Government Ayurved College, Nagpur, India.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features of complete responders versus non-complete responders to long-term treatment with biologics in patients with severe asthma attended in routine daily practice.
Data of a cohort of 90 patients with severe asthma who were treated with biologics (omalizumab, benralizumab, and mepolizumab) for at least 12 months and were followed up to March 2022. Data recorded included clinical characteristics and effectiveness of treatment (exacerbation, Asthma Control Test [ACT] score, lung function, use of maintenance oral corticosteroids [mOCS]), FeNO, and blood eosinophils at baseline, at 12 months, and at the end of follow-up. Complete response is considered if, in addition to not presenting exacerbations or the use of mOCS, the ACT score was >20 and, the FEV
An improvement in all asthma control parameters was observed after 12 months of treatment and a mean follow-up of 55 months. After 12 months of treatment 27.2% of patients met the criteria of complete response and this percentage even increased to 35.3% at the end of follow-up. Long-term complete response was associated to better lung function with mepolizumab and omalizumab treatment and to less previous exacerbations in the benralizumab group. The main cause of not achieving a complete response was the persistence of an airflow obstructive pattern.
This study shows that omalizumab, benralizumab, and mepolizumab improved the clinical outcomes of patients with severe asthma in a clinic environment with similar effect sizes to RCTs in the long term follow-up. Airflow obstruction, however, was a predictor of a non-complete response to biologics.
Treatment with anti-IgE and anti-IL-5 biologics significantly improved clinical outcomes in severe asthma patients.The rate of complete responders of 27.2% at 12 months even increased to 35.3% at the end of a mean follow-up of 55 months.The persistence of an airflow obstructive pattern was the main cause of the failure to achieve complete response.",,"[{'lastname': 'Basagaña', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Allergy Section, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Rivera', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Pneumology Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Padró', 'firstname': 'Clara', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Allergy Section, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia-Olivé', 'firstname': 'Ignasi', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Pneumology Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Colls', 'firstname': 'Mimar', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Navarro', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Pardo', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Otorhinolaryngology Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cruz', 'firstname': 'Paula', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Otorhinolaryngology Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cardona Peitx', 'firstname': 'Gloria', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacy Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Carabias', 'firstname': 'Lídia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacy Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Roger', 'firstname': 'Albert', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Allergy Section, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Abad', 'firstname': 'Jorge', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Pneumology Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosell', 'firstname': 'Antoni', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Pneumology Department, Severe Asthma Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}]"

We tested the hypothesis that susceptible young adults identified with chronic bronchitis and subtle lung function impairment will develop COPD later in life.
We followed random non-obstructive individuals aged 20-50years from two population-based cohorts from different smoking eras, the Copenhagen General Population Study from 2003(N=5497) and Copenhagen City Heart Study from 1976-78(N=2609), for 10 and 25years for development of COPD(forced expiratory volume in one second[FEV
After 10 years follow-up, 28% developed COPD and 13% COPD GOLD 2-4 in individuals susceptible to COPD compared to 8% and 1% in those without any susceptibility to COPD. Correspondingly, after 25years, 22% versus 13% developed COPD and 20% versus 8% developed COPD GOLD 2-4. More than half of incident COPD cases developed from a susceptible state. Compared to those without susceptibility to COPD, multivariable adjusted odds ratios in those susceptible to COPD were 3.42(95% confidence interval:2.78-4.21) for COPD and 10.1(6.77-15.2) for COPD GOLD 2-4 after 10years, and 1.54(1.23-1.93) and 2.12(1.64-2.73) after 25years. The ability of a COPD risk score consisting of the susceptibility state to COPD with smoking and asthma as risk factors to predict COPD later in life was high.

38364198,Ambient temperature and risk of cardiovascular and respiratory adverse health outcomes: a nationwide cross-sectional study from Spain.,2024-02-16,"We assessed the association of temperature and temperature variability with cause-specific emergency hospitalizations and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Spain, as well as the effect modification of this association by individual and contextual factors.
We collected data on health (hospital admissions and mortality), weather (temperature and relative humidity), and relevant contextual indicators for 48 Spanish provinces during 2004-2019. The statistical analysis was separately performed for the summer (June-September) and winter (December-March) seasons. We first applied a generalized linear regression model with quasi-Poisson distribution to estimate daily province-specific temperature-health associations, and then we fitted multilevel multivariate meta-regression models to the evaluate effect modification of the contextual characteristics on heat- and cold-related risks. High temperature increased the risk of mortality across all cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with the strongest effect for hypertension (relative risk (RR) at 99th temperature percentile vs. optimum temperature: 1.510 [95% empirical confidence interval {eCI} 1.251 to 1.821]), heart failure (1.528 [1.353 to 1.725]), and pneumonia (2.224 [1.685 to 2.936]). Heat also had an impact on all respiratory hospitalization causes (except asthma), with similar risks between pneumonia (1.288 [1.240 to 1.339]), acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis (1.307 [1.219 to 1.402]), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.260 [1.158 to 1.372]). We generally found significant risks related to low temperature for all cardiovascular and respiratory causes, with heart failure (RR at 1st temperature percentile vs. optimum temperature: 1.537 [1.329 to 1.779]) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.885 [1.646 to 2.159]) exhibiting the greatest risk for hospitalization, and acute myocardial infarction (1.860 [1.546 to 2.238]) and pneumonia (1.734 [1.219 to 2.468]) for mortality. Women and the elderly were more vulnerable to heat, while people with secondary education were less susceptible to cold compared to those not achieving this educational stage. Results from meta-regression showed that increasing heating access to the highest current provincial value (i.e. 95.6%) could reduce deaths due to cold by 59.5% (57.2 to 63.5).
Exposure to low and high temperatures was associated with a greater risk of morbidity and mortality from multiple cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, and heating was the most effective societal adaptive measure to reduce cold-related mortality.
Exposure to low and high temperatures increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from several cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, especially among the elderly.

Misdiagnosis at initial clinical examination is common, leading to early inappropriate treatment and increased in-hospital mortality. Risk factors of inappropriate treatment assessable at early examination remain undescribed herein. The objective of this study was to identify clinical risk factors of dyspnea and inappropriate treatment in patients admitted to ED. This is an observational retrospective cohort study. Patients over the age of 15 who were admitted to adult EDs of the University Hospital of Toulouse (France) with dyspnea were included from 1 July to 31 December 2019. The primary end-point was dyspnea and inappropriate treatment was initiated at ED. Inappropriate treatment was defined by looking at the final diagnosis of dyspnea at hospital discharge and early treatment provided. Afterward, this early treatment at ED was compared to the recommended treatment defined by the International Guidelines for Acute Heart Failure, bacterial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or pulmonary embolism. A total of 2123 patients were analyzed. Of these, 809 (38%) had inappropriate treatment in ED. Independent risk factors of inappropriate treatment were: age over 75 years (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18-1.81), history of heart disease (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.62) and lung disease (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.21-1.78), SpO2 <90% (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.37-2.02), bilateral rale (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.66), focal cracklings (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.66) and wheezing (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.31-2.03).

Shared genes among allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma (AA), and atopic dermatitis (AD) were extracted from the GWAS catalog. RNA-seq data of AR, AA, and AD from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database were preprocessed and subjected to differential gene expression analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were merged using the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) algorithm. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify modules associated with allergies. Components of Guominkang (GMK) were obtained from 6 databases and activate components were identified by SwissADME website. Utilizing the SwissTarget Prediction, PharmMapper, SymMap, and HERB, the targets of GMK were predicted and subsequently validated using gene chip data from our team previous study. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) related to the allergic constitution were also extracted based on a previous study. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using KOBAS-i on the GWAS, RRA, WGCNA modules, DEPs, and GMK targets. P values from multi-omics datasets were combined by meta-analysis, and Bonferroni correction was applied. The significant pathways were further validated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with intervention data of GMK. The GWAS results yielded 172 genes. Four datasets AR1, AA1, AD1, and AD2 were acquired from GSE75011, GSE125916, and GSE184237. The RRA algorithm identified 19 upregulated and 20 downregulated genes. WGCNA identified 5 significant modules, with the blue and turquoise modules displaying a moderate correlation with allergies. By performing network pharmacology analysis, we identified 127 active ingredients of GMK and predicted 618 targets. Validation using gene chip data confirmed 107 GMK targets. Single-omics pathway analysis was conducted using KOBAS-i, and 39 significant pathways were identified across multiple omics datasets. GSEA analysis using GMK intervention data identified 11 of 39 significant pathways as the final key pathways associated with the allergic constitution. Through multi-omics integrated pathway analysis, we identified 11 critical pathways of allergic constitution, including TH1 and TH2 cell differentiation, TLR cascade, and TH17 cell differentiation. Identifying these pathways suggests that the observed alterations at the pathway level may play significant roles in the molecular characteristics of the allergic constitution.",,"[{'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Pengcheng', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.\nNational Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Xing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.\nNational Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.\nNational Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Rongmin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Beijing Heniantang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Xuemei', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Zhuqing', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.\nNational Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cui', 'firstname': 'Diankun', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.\nNational Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ji', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Qi', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.'}]"

The effect of comorbid conditions such as obesity, smoking, other atopic conditions and psychosocial factors on asthma control and severity should be considered. Treatment can then be optimised by implementing personalised strategies, including the use of appropriate drug delivery devices and adherence monitoring. Biologics can be an alternative treatment option for selected patients but should not be a substitute for addressing poor adherence.

38363325,Deficiency of INPP4A promotes M2 macrophage polarization in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.,2024-02-16,"The treatment of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (E-CRSwNP) remains a challenge due to its complex pathogenesis. Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type IA (INPP4A), a lipid phosphatase, has been implicated in allergic asthma. However, the expression and function of INPP4A in E-CRSwNP remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of INPP4A in macrophages in E-CRSwNP.
We assessed the expression of INPP4A in human and mouse nasal mucosal tissues via immunofluorescence staining. THP-1 cells were cultured and exposed to various cytokines to investigate the regulation of INPP4A expression and its functional role. Additionally, we established a murine nasal polyp (NP) model and administrated an INPP4A-overexpressing lentivirus evaluate its impact on NP.
The percentage of INPP4A + CD68 + macrophages among total macrophages decreased in the E-CRSwNP group compared to the control and the non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (NE-CRSwNP) groups, exhibiting an inverse correlation with an increased percentage of CD206 + CD68 + M2 macrophages among total macrophages. Overexpression of INPP4A led to a reduced percentage of THP-1 cells polarizing towards the M2 phenotype, accompanied by decreased levels of associated chemotactic factors including CCL18, CCL22, CCL24, and CCL26. We also validated the involvement of the PI3K-AKT pathway in the function of INPP4A in vitro. Furthermore, INPP4A overexpression in the murine NP model resulted in the attenuation of eosinophilic inflammation in the nasal mucosa.
INPP4A deficiency promotes macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, leading to the secretion of chemokines that recruit eosinophils and Th2 cells, thereby amplifying eosinophilic inflammation in E-CRSwNP. INPP4A may exert a suppressive role in eosinophilic inflammation and could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic strategy.",,"[{'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yingying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Xiaoting', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Peiqiang', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Jingyu', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Siyuan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Duo', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gu', 'firstname': 'Tian', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Yulie', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Duo', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rhinology and Allergy, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuhan, 430060, China. xuy@whu.edu.cn.\nHubei Province Key Laboratory of Allergy and Immunity, Wuhan, China. xuy@whu.edu.cn.\nResearch Institute of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. xuy@whu.edu.cn.'}]"
38363050,Age-specific predictors of disease severity in children with respiratory syncytial virus infection beyond infancy and through the first 5 years of age.,2024-02-16,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with significant morbidity in infants. Risk factors for severe disease beyond the first 2 years of life have not been fully defined.
Children <5 years hospitalized with virologically confirmed RSV infection were identified over six respiratory seasons (10/2012-4/2018) and their medical records manually reviewed. Multivariable analyses were performed to define the age-specific (<6, 6-24, and >24-59 months) risk factors associated with oxygen administration, PICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospitalization.
We identified 5143 children hospitalized with RSV infection: 53.5% (n = 2749) <6 months; 31.7% (n = 1631) 6-24 months; and 14.8% (n = 763) >24-59 months. Rates of ICU admission were high (35%-36%) and comparable across age groups, while children >24-59 and 6-24 versus those <6 months required supplemental oxygen more frequently (73%; 71%; 68%, respectively; p = .003). The presence of comorbidities increased with age (25%, <6 months; 46%, 6-24 months; 70%, >24-59 months; p < .001). Specifically, neuromuscular disorders, chronic lung disease, and reactive airway disease/asthma were predictive of worse clinical outcomes in children aged 6-24 and >24-59 months, while RSV-viral codetections increased the risk of severe outcomes in children aged <6 and 6-24 months of age.
Almost half of children hospitalized with RSV infection were >6 months. Underlying comorbidities increased with age and remained associated with severe disease in older children, while RSV-viral codetections were predictive of worse clinical outcomes in the youngest age groups. These data suggest the importance of defining the clinical phenotype associated with severe RSV according to age, and the persistent burden associated with RSV beyond infancy.",,"[{'lastname': 'Brenes-Chacon', 'firstname': 'Helena', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Center for Vaccines and Immunity, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Nacional de Niños Dr. Carlos Sáenz Herrera, San José, Costa Rica.""}, {'lastname': 'Eisner', 'firstname': 'Mariah', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Acero-Bedoya', 'firstname': 'Santiago', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Center for Vaccines and Immunity, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Ramilo', 'firstname': 'Octavio', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Center for Vaccines and Immunity, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Mejias', 'firstname': 'Asuncion', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Center for Vaccines and Immunity, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""}]"
38362649,Probabilistic precision calculations for the planning of studies assessing negative binomial rates.,2024-02-16,"Outcome variables that are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution are frequently used in both clinical and epidemiological studies. Epidemiological studies, particularly those performed by pharmaceutical companies often aim to describe a population rather than compare treatments. Such descriptive studies are often analysed using confidence intervals. While precision calculations and sample size calculations are not always performed in these settings, they have the important role of setting expectations of what results the study may generate. Current methods for precision calculations for the negative binomial rate are based on plugging in parameter values into the confidence interval formulae. This method has the downside of ignoring the randomness of the confidence interval limits. To enable better practice for precision calculations, methods are needed that address the randomness.
Using the well-known delta-method we develop a method for calculating the precision probability, that is, the probability of achieving a certain width. We assess the performance of the method in smaller samples through simulations.
The method for the precision probability performs well in small to medium sample sizes, and the usefulness of the method is demonstrated through an example.
We have developed a simple method for calculating the precision probability for negative binomial rates. This method can be used when planning epidemiological studies in for example, asthma, while correctly taking the randomness of confidence intervals into account.",,"[{'lastname': 'Hedberg', 'firstname': 'Jonatan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Medical and Payer Evidence Statistics, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Franzén', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Medical and Payer Evidence Statistics, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}]"

Afghanistan is dealing with a double burden of diseases, yet there has been no evidence synthesis on the prevalence of major NCDs and their risk factors.
This study aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the existing data on the prevalence of major NCDs and the common related risk factors in Afghanistan.
We systematically reviewed scientific articles from 2000 to 2022 that reported the prevalence of diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or cancer, and their risk factors in Afghanistan. Four online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Google Scholar) and two local journals in Afghanistan (not indexed online) were systematically searched and screened. Two reviewers independently screened and appraised the quality of the articles. Data extraction and synthesis were performed using tabulated sheets.
Among 51 eligible articles, 10 (19.6%) focused on cancer, 10 (19.6%) on diabetes, 4 (7.8%) on CVDs, 4 (7.8%) on CRDs and 23 (45.1%) on risk factors as the primary outcome. Few articles addressed major NCD prevalence; no evidence of CVDs, cancer was 0.15%, asthma ranged between 0.3% and 17.3%, and diabetes was 12%. Pooled prevalence of hypertension and overweight were 31% and 35%, respectively. Central obesity was twice as prevalent in females (76% 
Only little evidence is available on the prevalence of major NCDs in Afghanistan; however, the NCD risk factors are prevalent across the country.

Important unresolved issues surround these tentative risk variants such as the characteristics of the associated genes and how they might elicit STBs.
Putative suicidality-related risk genes (PSRGs) were identified by comprehensive literature search and were characterized with respect to evolutionary conservation, participation in gene interaction networks and associated phenotypes. Evolutionary conservation was established with database searches and BLASTP queries, whereas gene-gene interactions were ascertained with GeneMANIA. We then examined whether mutations in risk-gene counterparts in 
From the analysis, 105 risk-gene candidates were identified and found to be: 1) highly conserved during evolution, 2) enriched for essential genes, 3) involved in significant gene-gene interactions, and 4) associated with psychiatric disorders, metabolic disturbances and asthma/allergy. Evaluation of 17 mutant strains with loss-of-function/deletion mutations in PSRG orthologs revealed that 11 mutants showed significant evidence of diminished motivation that manifested as immobility in a foraging assay. Immobility was corrected in some or all of the mutants with clozapine, lithium and tricyclic antidepressant drugs. In addition, 5-HT2 receptor and muscarinic receptor antagonists restored goal-directed behavior in most or all of the mutants.

Recent publications have highlighted the importance of incorporating SDOH considerations into research but the frequency with which this occurs in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) research is unclear. Our objective was to determine the frequency and categories of SDOH variables reported and how these variables were defined in published PICU randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
We searched Medline, Embase, Lilacs, and Central from inception to Dec 2022. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of any intervention on children or their families in a PICU. Data related to study demographics and nine WHO SDOH categories were extracted, and descriptive statistics and qualitative data generated.
586 unique RCTs were included. Studies had a median sample size of 60 patients (IQR 40-106) with 73.0% of studies including ≤100 patients and 41.1% including ≤50 patients. A total of 181 (181/586, 30.9%) studies reported ≥1 SDOH variable of which 163 (163/586, 27.8%) reported them by randomization group. The most frequently reported categories were food insecurity (100/586, 17.1%) and social inclusion and non-discrimination (73/586, 12.5%). Twenty-five of 57 studies (43.9%) investigating feeding or nutrition and 11 of 82 (13.4%) assessing mechanical ventilation reported baseline nutritional assessments. Forty-one studies investigated interventions in children with asthma or bronchiolitis of which six reported on smoking in the home (6/41, 14.6%).
Reporting of relevant SDOH variables occurs infrequently in PICU RCTs. In addition, when available, categorizations and definitions of SDOH vary considerably between studies.

38360901,[Precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of asthma].,2024-02-16,"Due to the availability of disease-modifying anti-asthmatic drugs (DMAADs), especially inhaled steroids (alone or in combination with long-acting bronchodilators), biologics and modern allergen immunotherapy, the treatment of asthma has fundamentally changed. The aims of modern asthma precision medicine are prevention of symptoms and the induction and maintenance of asthma remission (long-term asthma control, freedom from exacerbations and stable lung function without the use of systemic steroids). A treat to target approach is used as for other chronic inflammatory diseases in internal medicine: the aim is to achieve remission by an individually tailored treatment with DMAADs; however, the prerequisite for modern asthma precision medicine is asthma phenotyping, including a detailed medical history, lung function testing, allergological diagnostics and measurement of type 2 markers (blood eosinophils and, if available, exhaled nitric oxide, FeNO).
Durch die Verfügbarkeit von „disease-modifying anti-asthmatic drugs“ (DMAAD), insbesondere von inhalativen Steroiden (allein oder in Kombination mit langwirksamen Bronchodilatatoren), Biologika und modernen Allergenimmuntherapien, hat sich die Asthmatherapie grundsätzlich gewandelt. Ziele einer modernen Asthmapräzisionsmedizin sind die Symptomprävention und das Erreichen einer Asthmaremission (langfristige Symptomfreiheit, Exazerbationsfreiheit und stabile Lungenfunktion ohne Einsatz systemischer Steroide). Es wird, wie bei anderen chronisch-entzündlichen Erkrankungen der Inneren Medizin, ein Treat-to-target-Ansatz verfolgt: Ziel ist das Erreichen einer Remission durch eine individuell maßgeschneiderte Therapie mit DMAADs. Voraussetzung für die moderne Asthmapräzisionsmedizin ist jedoch die genaue Phänotypisierung der Patienten, inklusive sorgfältiger Anamneseerhebung, Lungenfunktionsprüfung, allergologischer Diagnostik und Bestimmung von Typ-2-Markern (Bluteosinophile und, falls verfügbar, Fraktion des exhalierten Stickstoffmonoxids [FeNO]).",,"[{'lastname': 'Lommatzsch', 'firstname': 'Marek', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Abteilung für Pneumologie, Zentrum für Innere Medizin, Universitätsmedizin Rostock, Ernst-Heydemann-Str.\xa06, 18057, Rostock, Deutschland. marek.lommatzsch@med.uni-rostock.de.'}]"
38360857,Bob1 maintains T follicular helper cells for long-term humoral immunity.,2024-02-16,"Humoral immunity is vital for host protection, yet aberrant antibody responses can trigger harmful inflammation and immune-related disorders. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, central to humoral immunity, have garnered significant attention for unraveling immune mechanisms. This study shows the role of B-cell Oct-binding protein 1 (Bob1), a transcriptional coactivator, in Tfh cell regulation. Our investigation, utilizing conditional Bob1-deficient mice, suggests that Bob1 plays a critical role in modulating inducible T-cell costimulator expression and cellular respiration in Tfh cells. This regulation maintains the long-term functionality of Tfh cells, enabling their reactivation from central memory T cells to produce antibodies during recall responses. In a bronchial asthma model induced by house dust mite (HDM) inhalation, Bob1 is observed to enhance HDM-specific antibodies, including IgE, highlighting its pivotal function in Tfh cell regulation. Further exploration of Bob1-dependent mechanisms in Tfh cells holds promise for governing protective immunity and addressing immune-related disorders.",,"[{'lastname': 'Yanagi', 'firstname':

38360807,Immune endotyping and gene expression profile of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in the aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and the non-AERD subgroups.,2024-02-16,"Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a paranasal sinus inflammatory disease and is divided into two subgroups defined as CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). CRSwNP displays a T helper (Th)2 biased phenotype, and based on sensitivity or tolerance to aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), is further subdivided into Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and non-AERD groups. Considering the challenge of diagnosis and treatment in patients with CRSwNP, particularly the AERD subtype, and the significance of endotyping in these patients, we examined the immune profile and endotyping based on gene expression analysis in the AERD and the non-AERD groups of patients with CRSwNP.
In this study, 21 patients were enrolled and were categorized into AERD (N = 10) and non-AERD (N = 11) groups based on their sensitivity to aspirin. After the special washing period, nasal polyps were biopsied in both groups, and the infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, and lymphocytes was compared between the AERD and the non-AERD groups. Also, gene expression levels of transcription factors including Tbet, GATA3, RoRγt, and FoxP3 and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)1β, IL1RAP (IL1 receptor accessory protein), IL2, IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13, IL17, TNFα, and IFNγ were investigated by quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Statistical analyses were performed using analytical tests including Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, and T-test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The mean ± SD age of the studied groups was 37 ± 8.7 years old (21-50) for the AERD, and 40.4 ± 7.7 years old (31-52) for the non-AERD. LMS/EPOS/SNOT scores and pulmonary function tests showed no difference between the two groups. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were found to be higher in patients with AERD (p = 0.04), however, the peripheral blood counts of eosinophils were comparable in the two groups. In the histopathologic analysis, the AERD group showed higher percentages of eosinophils (p = 0.04), neutrophils (p = 0.04), and plasma cells (p = 0.04) than the non-AERD group. Additionally, the gene expression levels of GATA3 (p = 0.001), IL4 (p = 0.04), IL5 (p = 0.007), and IL17 (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in the AERD than the non-AERD groups.
Higher gene expression levels of GATA3, IL4, IL5, and IL17 were observed in the AERD group compared with the non-AERD group. These findings point to distinct patterns of inflammation in patients with AERD, with a predominance of Th2 inflammation.","Higher gene expression levels of GATA3, IL4, IL5, and IL17 were observed in the AERD group compared with the non-AERD group.

38360670,Harnessing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonists to induce Heme Oxygenase-1: a promising approach for pulmonary inflammatory disorders.,2024-02-16,"The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ has been extensively shown to attenuate inflammatory responses in conditions such as asthma, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, as demonstrated in animal studies. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these inhibitory effects remain largely unknown. The upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been shown to confer protective effects, including antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo. PPARγ is highly expressed not only in adipose tissues but also in various other tissues, including the pulmonary system. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are highly selective agonists for PPARγ and are used as antihyperglycemic medications. These observations suggest that PPARγ agonists could modulate metabolism and inflammation. Several studies have indicated that PPARγ agonists may serve as potential therapeutic candidates in inflammation-related diseases by upregulating HO-1, which in turn modulates inflammatory responses. In the respiratory system, exposure to external insults triggers the expression of inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and reactive oxygen species, leading to the development of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that the upregulation of HO-1 protects tissues and cells from external insults, indicating that the induction of HO-1 by PPARγ agonists could exert protective effects by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways and attenuating the development of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying TZD-induced HO-1 expression are not well understood. This review aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which PPARγ agonists induce the expression of HO-1 and explore how they protect against inflammatory and oxidative responses.",,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'I-Ta', 'initials': 'IT', 'affiliation': 'School of Dentistry, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 110301, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Chien-Chung', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Taoyuan, Taoyuan, 333008, Taiwan.\nSchool of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, 333323, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Chuen-Mao', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Science, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, 242062, Taiwan. chuenmao@mail.cmu.edu.tw.'}]"
38360617,Prevalence of Rifampicin resistance tuberculosis among presumptive tuberculosis patients in Egypt-2021: a national health facility-based survey.,2024-02-16,"The magnitude of MDR-TB cases was noticeable in Egypt. However, the last national survey was 11-years ago. The current survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of rifampicin resistance among sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Egypt.
A national health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 14 randomly selected governorates in Egypt between August 2020 and September 2021. All presumptive TB cases, either new or previously treated according to WHO definitions, with no gender, age, or nationality limitations, and provided informed consent were included in the study. Each patient completed a case report form (CRF). The CRF included socio-demographic and clinical data. Sputum samples were collected according to standard techniques and cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium. Gene X-pert test was carried out first on the samples for simultaneous identification of MTB and rifampicin resistance. The prevalence of RR was calculated using crude, cluster, and weighted methods. Factors associated with RR were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate techniques.
Among the total 849 presumptive TB patients enrolled in the study, 710 (83.6%) patients were subjected to Gene X-pert testing (MTB/RIF). The crude prevalence of RR was 3.32% (95% CI: 1.89-4.76%) among the new cases and 9.46% (95% CI: 2.63-16.29%) among the retreated cases with an overall estimate of 3.99%; (95% CI: 2.51-5.47%). By cluster analysis the overall prevalence of RR was 5.01% (95% CI: 2.90-7.13). Factors associated with the prevalence of RR were co-morbidity with bronchial asthma, drug abuse and history of contact with a family member with TB.

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that identifies which climate-health relationships pose the greatest threat the children.
We reviewed epidemiologic studies to analyse various child-health outcomes due to climate change and identify the relationships with the largest effect size. We identify population-specific risks and provide recommendations for future research.
We searched four large online databases for observational studies published up to 5 January 2023 following PRISMA (systematic review) guidelines. We evaluated each included study individually and aggregated relevant quantitative data. We used quantitative data in our meta-analysis, where we standardised effect sizes and compared them among different groupings of climate variables and health outcomes.
Of 1301 articles we identified, 163 studies were eligible for analysis. We identified many relationships between climate change and child health, the strongest of which was increasing risk (60 % on average) of preterm birth from exposure to temperature extremes. Respiratory disease, mortality, and morbidity, among others, were also influenced by climate changes. The effects of different air pollutants on health outcomes were considerably smaller compared to temperature effects, but with most (16/20 = 80 %) pollutant studies indicating at least a weak effect. Most studies occurred in high-income regions, but we found no geographical clustering according to health outcome, climate variable, or magnitude of risk. The following factors were protective of climate-related child-health threats: (i) economic stability and strength, (ii) access to quality healthcare, (iii) adequate infrastructure, and (iv) food security. Threats to these services vary by local geographical, climate, and socio-economic conditions. Children will have increased prevalence of disease due to anthropogenic climate change, and our quantification of the impact of various aspects of climate change on child health can contribute to the planning of mitigation that will improve the health of current and future generations.",,"[{'lastname': 'Weeda', 'firstname': 'Lewis J Z', 'initials': 'LJZ', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.

38360295,Identification of toxicity-induced biomarkers in human non-immune airway cells exposed to respiratory sensitizers: a mechanistic approach.,2024-02-16,"Occupational asthma covers a group of work-related diseases whose clinical manifestations include airway hyperresponsiveness and airflow limitation. Although the chemical respiratory allergy (CRA) induced by Low Molecular Weight (LMW) sensitizers is a major concern, especially in terms of the regulatory framework, to date there are no methods available for preclinically addressing this toxicological outcome, as its mechanistic background is not fully understood at molecular or cellular levels. This paper proposes a mechanistic study applying New Approach Methodologies (NAM) of the pro-inflammatory and functional effects triggered by LMW respiratory allergens in different respiratory tract cell lines, including bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B), lung fibroblast (MRC-5), and endothelial cells (EA.hy926), and an analysis of the capacity of such chemicals to interact with the mucin protein, to address certain toxicodynamic aspects of such compounds. The results showed that some of the sensitizers evaluated interact with mucin, the main protein mucus component, but the toxicant-mucin complex formation does not seem to be a common feature of different chemical classes of allergens. At a cellular level, sensitizers promoted an increase in IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1β production in the evaluated cell types. It also impaired the MUC1 expression by bronchial cells and activated endothelial cells, thereby increasing the ICAM-I surface expression. Taken together, our results showed that these aforementioned cell types participate in the CRA Adverse Outcome Pathway and must be considered when developing preclinical testing strategies, particularly investigating danger signal production after exposure to LMW sensitizers in different tissue compartments.",,"[{'lastname': 'Garcia da Silva', 'firstname': 'Artur Christian', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In vitro Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, GO, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Carvalho Filho', 'firstname': 'Sérgio de Morais', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In vitro Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, GO, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Furtado de Mendonça', 'firstname': 'Izadora Caroline', 'initials': 'IC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In vitro Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, GO, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Valadares', 'firstname': 'Marize Campos', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In vitro Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, GO, Brazil.

38360214,Vitamin D primary prevention of respiratory infections and asthma in early childhood: evidence and mechanisms.,2024-02-16,"Respiratory infections are a leading cause of child morbidity worldwide and asthma is the most common chronic disorder in childhood. Both conditions associate with high socioeconomic costs and are major reasons for medication prescriptions and hospitalizations in children. Vitamin D deficiency has concomitantly increased with asthma prevalence and is hypothesized to play a key role in the development. Current evidence suggests that high prenatal and early childhood vitamin D could be protective against respiratory infections and asthma in some studies where several mechanisms are proposed. However, other studies have reported no effects on these outcomes. Therefore, future large intervention studies on this topic are warranted. Mechanistic studies have shown that vitamin D holds antimicrobial properties by inducing production of several peptides through altered gene expression. Others have shown a complex interplay between asthma risk genotypes, the sphingolipid pathway and prenatal vitamin D in early childhood asthma. Vitamin D has also been suggested to change both airway immune- and microbiota profiles, which are directly related to asthma risk. Finally, systemic low-grade inflammation seems to be regulated by vitamin D exposure. This review presents current literature of the primary preventive effect of vitamin D on early childhood asthma and respiratory infections.

38360213,Lebrikizumab in Uncontrolled Asthma: Reanalysis in a Well-Defined Type 2 Population.,2024-02-16,"LAVOLTA (L)I, LII, and ACOUSTICS were randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trials of lebrikizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-13, in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Failure to demonstrate efficacy may have been related to patient selection in those trials.
To assess the efficacy in a well-defined subpopulation of patients with elevated blood eosinophil counts and a minimum number of prior asthma exacerbations. An additional analysis in a subpopulation of patients with elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and prior exacerbations was performed.
Adult (LI and LII) and adolescent patients (12-17 years weighing ≥40kg, ACOUSTICS) with uncontrolled asthma received lebrikizumab (125mg, N=832 or 37.5mg, N=829) or placebo (N=833) subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Post-hoc analysis of the annualized adjusted exacerbation rate (AER) was performed in a subpopulation of patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL and history of ≥1 exacerbation. In this subpopulation, there were 227 patients in the placebo group, 222 patients in the lebrikizumab 37.5mg group, and 217 patients in the lebrikizumab 125mg group. Safety in patients who received at least 1 dose of lebrikizumab was summarized using adverse events (AEs).
Lebrikizumab significantly reduced AER vs. placebo in adults (AER reduction:125mg, 38%; 37.5mg, 41%) and adolescents (AER reduction:125mg, 59%; 37.5mg, 64%) with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL and ≥1 exacerbation. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to treatment discontinuation.

Considering the increasing prevalence of obesity in C-SCD, It is important to explore the influence of body mass index (BMI) on OAD in this disease population.
A longitudinal retrospective chart review was conducted on 55 C-SCD (161 IOS observations) and 35 non-SCD asthmatic children (C-Asthma) (58 observations), primarily to investigate the association between BMI and airway resistance in C-SCD and C-Asthma.

38360181,Accurate determination of house dust mite sensitization in asthma and allergic rhinitis through cytometric detection of Der p 1 and Der p 2 binding on Basophils (CytoBas).,2024-02-16,"House dust mite (HDM) is the most common allergen trigger globally for allergic rhinitis and atopic asthma. To expedite accurate confirmation of allergen sensitization, we designed fluorescent allergen tetramers to directly stain specific IgE on basophils to detect specific allergen sensitization using the flow cytometric CytoBas assay.
Recombinant proteins of major HDM allergens (component), Der f 1, Der p 1 and Der p 2 were biotinylated and conjugated with fluorochrome streptavidins as tetramers. Blood samples from 64 HDM-allergic patients and 26 non-HDM-sensitized controls were incubated with allergen tetramers for evaluation of basophil binding (CytoBas) and activation (BAT) with flow cytometry.
The tetramers effectively bound and activated basophils from allergic patients but not non-sensitized controls. CytoBas with Der p 1 as a single allergen had comparable sensitivity and specificity (92% and 100%) to BAT (91% and 100%) in detecting allergen sensitization, as did CytoBas with Der p 2 (95% and 96%) to BAT (95% and 87%). A positive staining for Der p 1 and/or Der p 2 in CytoBas was 100% sensitive and 96% specific for HDM allergy.
CytoBas has diagnostic accuracy for group 1 and group 2 HDM allergens that is comparable to BAT, but with additional advantages of multiple allergen components in a single tube and no requirement for in vitro basophil activation. These findings endorse a single, multiplex CytoBas assay for accurate and component-resolved diagnosis of aeroallergen sensitization in patients with allergic asthma and/or rhinitis.",,"[{'lastname': 'Hsin', 'firstname': 'Lin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Varese', 'firstname': 'Nirupama', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Immune Therapies Group, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Aui', 'firstname': 'Pei Mun', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wines', 'firstname': 'Bruce D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Immune Therapies Group, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'von Borstel', 'firstname': 'Anouk', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mascarell', 'firstname': 'Laurent', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Innovation & Science Department, Stallergenes Greer, Antony, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Hogarth', 'firstname': 'P Mark', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Immune Therapies Group, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hew', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Hehir"", 'firstname': 'Robyn E', 'initials': 'RE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'van Zelm', 'firstname': 'Menno C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;; Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Interaction patterns between IgE antibodies to individual allergenic molecules on component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) multiplex arrays might be hallmarks by which different sensitization subtypes relevant to asthma can be distinguished. These different subtypes of sensitization are associated amongst sensitized individuals at all ages, with different clinical presentations (no disease, asthma as a single disease, and allergic multimorbidity); amongst sensitized preschool children with and without lower airway symptoms, with different risk of subsequent asthma development; and amongst sensitized patients with asthma, with differing levels of asthma severity.

38358481,[Pitfalls in the diagnosis of house dust mite allergy].,2024-02-15,"House dust mite (HDM) is the most significant indoor allergen, responsible for not only many cases of rhinoconjunctivitis but also for many cases of bronchial asthma, rendering it of considerable socioeconomic relevance. Besides symptomatic treatment and avoidance measures, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is crucial, as the only causal, disease-modifying therapeutic approach. However, high diagnostic certainty is essential for initiating AIT. The challenge in making a correct diagnosis lies in interpreting the demonstrated HDM sensitization regarding its clinical relevance (clinically silent sensitization vs. allergy). While the risk of allergy increases with the level of IgE titers against HDM extract, Der p 1, or Der p 2, as well as with the breadth of the molecular sensitization profile against HDM components (Der p 1, Der p 2, Der p 23), no threshold can be defined for the presence of allergy, nor can sensitization to a specific component be confidently considered allergy inducing. It should be noted that at least in Southern Bavaria, the prevalence of Der p 23 sensitization is too low to be considered a major allergen, and Der p 23 is not able to molecularly differentiate all HDM sensitizations when added to the two major allergens Der p 1 and Der p 2. Evidently, HDM possesses a diverse profile of allergens, with some relevant ones possibly yet to be described. Unfortunately, patient history does not provide a sufficient assessment of the clinical relevance of a demonstrated HDM sensitization, necessitating allergen provocation testing before initiating AIT with HDM, despite the relatively large effort involved.
Bei der Hausstaubmilbe (HSM) handelt es sich um das bedeutendste Innenraumallergen, das für viele Fälle nicht nur von Rhinoconjunctivitis allergica, sondern auch Asthma bronchiale verantwortlich und somit von erheblicher sozioökonomischer Relevanz ist. Neben symptomatischer Therapie und Karenzmaßnahmen ist v. a. die Allergenimmuntherapie (AIT) als einziger kausaler, krankheitsmodifizierender Therapieansatz von großer Bedeutung. Für die Einleitung einer AIT ist allerdings eine hohe diagnostische Sicherheit unerlässlich. Die Schwierigkeit einer korrekten Diagnosestellung liegt darin, die nachgewiesene HSM-Sensibilisierung hinsichtlich ihrer klinischen Relevanz (klinisch stumme Sensibilisierung vs. Allergie) richtig zu interpretieren. Das Allergierisiko steigt zwar mit der Höhe des IgE-Titers gegen HSM-Extrakt, Der p 1 oder Der p 2, wie auch mit der Breite des molekularen Sensibilisierungsprofils gegen HSM-Komponenten (Der p 1, Der p 2, Der p 23) an, jedoch kann weder bezüglich der Titer ein Schwellenwert für das Vorliegen einer Allergie definiert werden, noch kann eine Sensibilisierung gegen eine spezifische Komponente als sicher allergieauslösend bewertet werden. Zudem muss festgehalten werden, dass – zumindest in Südbayern – die Prävalenz der Der-p-23-Sensibilisierung zu niedrig ist, um als Majorallergen zu gelten, noch ist Der p 23 als Ergänzung zu den beiden Majorallergenen Der p 1 und Der p 2 in der Lage, alle HSM-Sensibilisierungen molekular aufzulösen. Offensichtlich verfügt die HSM über ein sehr diverses Profil an Allergenen, von denen einige relevante noch nicht beschrieben zu sein scheinen. Auch anamnestische Angaben erlauben keine ausreichend sichere Bewertung der klinischen Relevanz einer nachgewiesenen HSM-Sensibilisierung, sodass – trotz des relativ großen Aufwands – vor Einleitung einer AIT mit HSM eine Allergen-Provokationstestung empfohlen werden muss.",,"[{'lastname': 'Huber', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Klinik und Poliklinik für Hals-Nasen-Ohrenheilkunde, Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Marchioninistr.\xa015, 81377, München, Deutschland.'}, {'lastname': 'Becker', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Hals‑, Nasen- und Ohrenheilkunde, Universitätsklinik Tübingen, Tübingen, Deutschland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gröger', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Klinik und Poliklinik für Hals-Nasen-Ohrenheilkunde, Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Marchioninistr.\xa015, 81377, München, Deutschland. moritz.groeger@med.uni-muenchen.de.'}]"

38358037,Exploratory analysis of the economically justifiable price of nirsevimab for healthy late-preterm and term infants in Colombia.,2024-02-15,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection is the leading cause of lower respiratory infection globally. Recently, nirsevimab has been approved to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. This study explores the economically justifiable price of nirsevimab for preventing RSV infection in Colombia's children under 1 year of age.
A static model was developed using the decision tree microsimulation to estimate the quality-adjusted costs and life years of two interventions: a single intramuscular dose of nirsevimab versus not applying nirsevimab. This analysis was made during a time horizon of 1 year and from a societal perspective.
The annual savings in Colombia associated with this cost per dose ranged from U$ 2.5 to 4.1 million. Based on thresholds of U$ 4828, U$ 5128, and U$ 19 992 per QALY evaluated in this study, we established economically justifiable drug acquisition prices of U$ 21.88, U$ 25.04, and U$ 44.02 per dose of nirsevimab.
the economically justifiable cost for nirsevimab in Colombia is between U$ 21 to U$ 44 per dose, depending on the willingness to pay used to decide its implementation. This result should encourage more studies in the region that optimize decision-making processes when incorporating this drug into the health plans of each country.","the economically justifiable cost for nirsevimab in Colombia is between U$ 21 to U$ 44 per dose, depending on the willingness to pay used to decide its implementation.

38357399,Sociodemographic correlates with prevalence of comorbidities in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a study from a Chinese National Survey.,2024-02-15,"An increase in the prevalence of comorbidities has been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, contemporary estimates of the overall prevalence of the sociodemographic correlates of COPD comorbidities are scarce and inconsistent in China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of sociodemographic correlates of comorbidities in patients with COPD across China.
This was a cross-sectional study. We used data from the Enjoying Breathing Program between May 2020 and April 2022. Participants with COPD from 17 provinces (or equivalent) were included. Comorbidity clusters were stratified based on the number of comorbidities per person. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to determine the sociodemographic associations of patients with COPD with specific clusters of comorbidities after adjusting for age, sex, and other prespecified covariates. Tetrachoric correlation analyses were performed to determine the associations between specific comorbidities.
A total of 3913 participants with COPD were included, of whom 1744 (44.7%) had at least one comorbidity; 25.4% had one comorbid disease, 12.9% had two, and 6.4% had three or more concurrent diseases. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (17.8%), asthma (9.9%), bronchiectasis (8.2%), diabetes (8.2%), and coronary artery disease (7.7%). In the logistic regression models adjusted for a broad set of factors, patients with COPD residing in the east region of China and having health insurance experienced a decreased likelihood of comorbidities (from OR = 0.70 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.93] to OR = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.25-0.99]). However, patients over 80 years had increased risk (OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.01-2.03]), as did those in all Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) grade categories (grade 1: OR = 1.30 [95% CI, 1.02-1.65]; grade 2: OR = 1.39 [95% CI, 1.07-1.8]; grade 3: OR = 1.67 [95% CI, 1.23-2.26]; and grade 4: OR = 1.81 [95% CI, 1.00-3.28]) and in Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2 classification (OR = 1.30 [95% CI, 1.03-1.65]) relative to their respective references. The associations observed in these subgroups were consistent regardless of the number of comorbidities per person. Tetrachoric correlations demonstrated negative associations in pairwise comparisons of the top five comorbidities, ranging from -0.03 to -0.31 (p < 0.001 in all groups).
In China, comorbidities are highly prevalent among patients with COPD, with older age, higher mMRC grade, and lung function decline being the major risk factors. Studies with larger sample sizes are required to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying COPD comorbidities.

38356668,MicroRNAs in chronic pediatric diseases (Review).,2024-02-15,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with a length of 20-24 nucleotides. They bind to the 3'-untranslated region of target genes to induce the degradation of target mRNAs or inhibit their translation. Therefore, they are involved in the regulation of development, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and other biological processes (including hormone secretion, signaling and viral infections). Chronic diseases in children may be difficult to treat and are often associated with malnutrition resulting from a poor diet. Consequently, further complications, disease aggravation and increased treatment costs impose a burden on patients and their families. Existing evidence suggests that microRNAs are involved in various chronic non-neoplastic diseases in children.

38356163,Feasibility of Constant Work Rate Testing to Detect Exercise-Induced Laryngeal Obstruction.,2024-02-15,"Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO) is a condition in which laryngeal structures inappropriately obstruct the upper airway during exercise. The standard diagnostic test for EILO is the continuous laryngoscopy during exercise (CLE) test, usually performed with an incremental work rate protocol regardless of the nature of the triggering event. Typically, laryngeal obstruction occurs only briefly at the end of an incremental test, near peak work capacity. We aimed to investigate constant work rate (CWR) protocols for CLE testing to expand diagnostic test modalities and improve the understanding of EILO.
In this prospective, self-controlled feasibility study, 10 patients with EILO performed both an incremental and a CWR CLE test at 70%, 80%, and 90% of maximal exercise capacity. Laryngoscopic video data were recorded and compared, and we evaluated the ability of CWR to reproduce the symptoms and laryngeal obstruction seen in incremental testing.
In 70%-90% of cases, CWR testing induced at least the same severity of obstruction as incremental testing and CLE scores remained comparable across test modalities. CWR at 70% allowed observation of laryngeal obstruction for a significantly longer duration than in incremental testing (158 s; 95% confidence interval, 25-291 s; P = 0.027). Dyspnea intensity appeared higher during CWR testing compared with incremental testing.
Submaximal CWR CLE testing is feasible and able to induce EILO equivalent to the standard incremental CLE test.

In addition, noninvasive pulmonary delivery also presents an attractive alternative to systemically administered therapeutics, not only for localized respiratory disorders but also for systemic absorption. Pulmonary delivery offers the advantages of a relatively low dose, low incidence of systemic side effects, and rapid onset of action for some drugs compared to other systemic administration routes. While promising, inhaled delivery of therapeutics is often complex owing to factors encompassing mechanical barriers, chemical barriers, selection of inhalation device, and limited choice of dosage form excipients. There are very few excipients that are approved by the FDA for use in developing inhaled drug products. Depending upon the dosage form, and inhalation devices such as pMDIs, DPIs, and nebulizers, different excipients can be used to provide physical and chemical stability and to deliver the dose efficiently to the lungs.

We aimed to summarize available evidence considering the association between light at night exposure and major allergic diseases through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
We completed a search of six databases, two registries, and Google Scholar from inception until December 15, 2023, and included studies that investigated the influence of artificial light at night (ALAN, high vs. low exposure), chronotype (evening vs. morning chronotype), or shift work (night vs. day shift work) on allergic disease outcomes (asthma, allergic rhinitis, and skin allergies). We performed inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses to examine the association between the exposures (ALAN exposure, chronotype, or shiftwork) and these allergic outcomes. Stratification analyses were conducted by exposure type, disease type, participant age, and geographical location along with sensitivity analyses to assess publication bias.
We included 12 publications in our review. We found that exposure to light at night was associated with higher odds of allergic diseases, with the strongest association observed for ALAN exposure (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.04 to 3.39), followed by evening chronotype (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.87) and exposure to night shift work (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.67). When analyses were stratified by disease types, light at night exposure was significantly associated with asthma (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.20), allergic rhinitis (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.60 to 2.24), and skin allergies (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.91). We also found that the association between light at night exposure and allergic diseases was more profound in youth (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.48) than adults (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.63). Additionally, we observed significant geographical variations in the association between light at night exposure and allergic diseases.

38355550,Global patterns of asthma burden related to environmental risk factors during 1990-2019: an age-period-cohort analysis for global burden of disease study 2019.,2024-02-15,"Change in asthma burden attributed to specific environmental risk factor has not been evaluated.
We aimed to explore the age, period, and cohort effects on asthma burden attributable to smoking and occupational asthmagens in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions and the region and sex disparities.
Risk factor-specific asthma deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates were extracted from Global Burden of Disease study 2019, estimated by standard Combined Cause of Death Model and DisMod-MR 2.1 modeling tool. Age-period-cohort analysis was conducted to decompose age, period, and cohort effects on asthma burden.
Smoking- and occupational asthmagens-related asthma deaths and DALYs rates dropped by > 45% during 1990-2019. In 2019, Africa, South and Southeast Asia had higher asthma burden than other regions. Male had higher asthma burden than female. Among nearly all age groups, low-middle SDI region had the highest smoking-related asthma burden, and low SDI region had the highest occupational asthmagens-related asthma burden. Inverse ""V"" shaped trend was observed in the above regions with increasing age. For smoking-related asthma deaths and DALYs rates, the most significant improvement of period rate ratio (RR) occurred in high SDI region, decreased from 1.67 (1.61, 1.74) to 0.34 (0.33, 0.36) and 1.61 (1.57, 1.66) to 0.59 (0.57, 0.61), respectively, as well as the cohort effect on smoking-related asthma burden. For occupational asthmagens-related asthma deaths and DALYs rates, the most sharply decrease of period and cohort RR appeared in the high and high-middle SDI regions. Low SDI region showed least progress in period and cohort RR of smoking- and occupational asthmagens-linked asthma burden.
Smoking- and occupational asthmagens-related asthma burden sharply decreases, but region and sex disparities exist. Policy makers from low SDI region should reinforce tobacco control and prioritize workplace protection.","Smoking- and occupational asthmagens-related asthma burden sharply decreases, but region and sex disparities exist.

This requires accurate and complete ascertainment of a broad range of diagnoses, something not always recorded on an admission document at a single point in time. This study aimed to ascertain how far back in time electronic hospital records need to be interrogated to capture long-term condition diagnoses.
Retrospective observational study of routinely collected hospital electronic health record data.
Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (UK)-linked data held by the PIONEER acute care data hub.
Patients whose first recorded admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation (n=560) or acute stroke (n=2142) was between January and December 2018 and who had a minimum of 10 years of data prior to the index date.
We identified the most common International Classification of Diseases version 10-coded diagnoses received by patients with COPD and acute stroke separately. For each diagnosis, we derived the number of patients with the diagnosis recorded at least once over the full 10-year lookback period, and then compared this with shorter lookback periods from 1 year to 9 years prior to the index admission.
Seven of the top 10 most common diagnoses in the COPD dataset reached >90% completeness by 6 years of lookback. Atrial fibrillation and diabetes were >90% coded with 2-3 years of lookback, but hypertension and asthma completeness continued to rise all the way out to 10 years of lookback. For stroke, 4 of the top 10 reached 90% completeness by 5 years of lookback; angina pectoris was >90% coded at 7 years and previous transient ischaemic attack completeness continued to rise out to 10 years of lookback.

38355013,Systemic Inflammation in Asthma: What are the risks and impacts outside the airway?,2024-02-15,"Airway inflammation in asthma has been well recognized for several decades, with general agreement on its role in asthma pathogenesis, symptoms, propensity toward exacerbation, and decline in lung function. This has led to universal recommendation in asthma management guidelines to incorporate the use of inhaled corticosteroid as an anti-inflammatory therapy for all patients with persistent asthma symptoms. However, there has been limited attention paid to the presence and potential impact of systemic inflammation in asthma. Accumulating evidence from epidemiological observations and cohort studies points to a host of downstream organ dysfunction in asthma especially among patients with longstanding or more severe disease, frequent exacerbations, and underlying risk factors for organ dysfunction. Most studies to date have focused on cognitive impairment, depression/anxiety, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular abnormalities. In this review, we summarize some of the evidence demonstrating these abnormalities, highlight the proposed mechanisms and potential benefits of treatment in limiting these extrapulmonary abnormalities in patients with asthma. The goal of this commentary is to raise awareness of the importance of recognizing potential extra-pulmonary conditions associated with systemic inflammation of asthma.

Danish target-trial-emulation study including 43,061 individuals aged ≥65 years (54.1% females, mean age 77.8 years) with a first redeemed prescription for depression with sertraline (n = 6673), escitalopram (n = 7104) or citalopram (n = 29,284) in 2006-2017. Individuals had cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease (COPD)/asthma, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, or osteoporosis. Outcomes were treatment switching, combination/augmentation, psychiatric hospital contact for depression, and any psychiatric in-patient care. Follow-up was one year and adjusted Cox regression analyses calculated hazard rate ratios (HRR) within each somatic disease.
Across all six disease groups and four outcomes, we found that citalopram use, compared with sertraline, was associated with lower risks in several analyses, with statistically significant results in cancer, CVD, COPD/asthma, and diabetes (e.g., HRRs for psychiatric hospital contacts for depression/any psychiatric in-patient care ranging between 0.47 and 0.61). For escitalopram, compared with sertraline, some analyses indicated poorer outcomes with significantly higher risks for combination/augmentation treatment (HRRs ranging between 1.15 and 1.40).

38354337,The impact of different data handling strategies in exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of diary measures: an evaluation using simulated and real-world asthma nighttime symptoms diary data.,2024-02-14,"Daily diaries are an important modality for patient-reported outcome assessment. They typically comprise multiple questions, so understanding their underlying structure is key to appropriate analysis and interpretation. Structural evaluation of such measures poses challenges due to the high volume of repeated measurements. Potential strategies include selecting a single day, averaging item-level observations over time, or using all data while accounting for its multilevel structure.
The above strategies were evaluated in a simulated dataset via exploratory and confirmatory factor modelling by comparing their impact on various estimates (i.e., inter-item correlations, factor loadings, model fit). Each strategy was additionally explored using real-world data from an observational study (the Asthma Nighttime Symptoms Diary).
Both single day and item average strategies resulted in biased factor loadings. The former displayed lower overall bias (single day: 0.064; item average: 0.121) and mean square error (single day: 0.007; item average: 0.016) but greater frequency of incorrect factor number identification compared with the latter (single day: 46.4%; item average: 0%). Increased estimated inter-item correlations were apparent in the item-average method. Non-trivial between- and within-person variance highlighted the utility of a multilevel approach. However, convergence issues and Heywood cases were more common under the multilevel approach (90.2% and 100.0%, respectively).
Our findings suggest that a multilevel approach can enhance our insight when evaluating the structural properties of daily diary data; however, implementation challenges still remain.

Seventy-eight percent of the participants responded that they had a national urticaria management guideline written by their professional societies and 28% responded that they had to operate under a regulatory guideline proposed by central health funding organizations. Seventy-two and 58.7% of these national recommendations do not contain any detailed information on when and/or how CSU treatment should be discontinued. There was a lack of detailed information on antihistamines and cyclosporine in particular. A predefined maximum duration was generally not applicable to omalizumab and cyclosporine (81% and 82%, respectively). Nearly all UCAREs step down omalizumab within 6 months from the first controlled status and 42% discontinue cyclosporine after 6 months regardless of the control status.
The findings from the SDown-CSU study clearly highlight a global need for guidance on the process of stepping down treatment in CSU.

The researchers also measured the levels of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde in the lungs.
The results showed that ovalbumin-induced airway hyper-responsiveness led to a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. However, the flavonoids significantly decreased the severity of airway inflammation. Histopathology results also supported the effectiveness of the flavonoids. These findings suggest that these flavonoids could be a supplementary and alternative treatment for asthma by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory pathway.
The findings suggest that the isolated compounds have the potential to act cumulatively to decrease the levels of the tested cytokines, normalize eosinophil and activated lymphocyte counts, and significantly reduce MPO and MDA.

We evaluated the extent to which higher pollen exposure was associated with differences in airway inflammation and lung function among 490 early adolescent participants (mean age of 12.9 years) in Project Viva, a prebirth cohort based in Massachusetts. We obtained regional daily total pollen counts, including tree, grass, and weed pollen, from a Rotorod pollen counter. We evaluated associations of 3- and 7-day moving averages of pollen with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and lung function using linear regression models and evaluated the linearity of associations with penalized splines. We tested if associations of pollen with FeNO and lung function were modified by current asthma diagnosis, history of allergic rhinitis, aeroallergen sensitivity, temperature, precipitation, and air pollution.

38352722,Pharmacist Review of Chronic Inhaler Therapy Appropriateness for Hospitalized Patients with COPD or Asthma.,2024-02-14,"Patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease rely on inhaler therapy to reduce disease progression and exacerbation risk. Patients admitted to the hospital are at an increased risk for exacerbations and readmission if their inhaler therapy upon discharge is not aligned with current guidelines and/or affordable.
Assess the appropriateness of the chronic inhaler regimen for patients admitted to the hospital based on clinical practice guidelines and insurance coverage.
A sub-study was designed to analyze a cohort of a single-center, pragmatic, prospective randomized controlled trial at a large academic medical center. Patients admitted to a medicine service with a pharmacist and prescribed a long-acting inhaler were included. Participants randomized to a pharmacist-led intervention were assessed for inhaler appropriateness based on clinical guidelines and patient insurance. The objective of this sub-study is to assess the number of inhalers identified as inappropriate based on the pharmacist's review. A patient was considered to have an inappropriate inhaler regimen if any of their inhalers were inconsistent with guideline recommendations or not covered by insurance. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize appropriate inhaler use.
The study pharmacist reviewed 552 unique inhalers for 348 patients. Overall, 42% of inhalers were inappropriate, affecting 50.3% of participants. 20% of inhalers were inappropriate based on insurance, 26% were inappropriate based on guidelines, and 7% were inappropriate based on both criteria. Recommendations were placed via a pharmacy consult for 198 patients (57%), most recommending an inhaler initiation (55%), followed by inhaler discontinuation (38%).
A pharmacist-led review of chronic inhaler therapy for patients admitted to the hospital identified the need for a change in therapy based on financial or clinical guidelines in over half of the patients reviewed.

How testing benefits diverse populations of adults with asthma, and the importance of the testing modality used, are not fully understood.
We sought to evaluate whether receipt of aeroallergen testing was associated with a reduction in oral corticosteroid (OCS) bursts.
We used electronic health record data to conduct a retrospective, observational cohort study of adults with asthma who were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid and had an Allergy/Immunology visit in a large health system between 1/1/2017-6/30/2022. Negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate whether OCS bursts in the 12-month period after an initial visit were reduced for patients who received aeroallergen testing. We also measured differences in benefit after excluding patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking histories, and whether testing receipt was via skin prick or serum.

38352523,Spatiotemporal Clusters of ERK Activity Coordinate Cytokine-induced Inflammatory Responses in Human Airway Epithelial Cells.,2024-02-14,"Spatially coordinated ERK signaling events (""SPREADs"") transmit radially from a central point to adjacent cells via secreted ligands for EGFR and other receptors. SPREADs maintain homeostasis in non-pulmonary epithelia, but it is unknown whether they play a role in the airway epithelium or are dysregulated in inflammatory disease.
(1) To characterize the spatial heterogeneity of ERK activity in response to pro-inflammatory ligands, and (2) to assess the effects of pharmacological and metabolic regulators on cytokine-mediated SPREADs.
Live-cell ERK biosensor activity and SPREAD events were measured in human bronchial epithelial cell lines (HBE1 and 16HBE) and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBE), in both submerged and biphasic Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) culture conditions (i.e., differentiated cells). Cells were exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines relevant to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to pharmacological treatments (gefitinib, tocilizumab, hydrocortisone) and metabolic modulators (insulin, 2-deoxyglucose) to probe the airway epithelial mechanisms of SPREADs. Phospho-STAT3 immunofluorescence was used to measure localized inflammatory responses to IL-6.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly increased the frequency of SPREADs. Notably, differentiated pHBE cells display increased SPREAD frequency that coincides with airway epithelial barrier breakdown. SPREADs correlate with IL-6 peptide secretion and localized pSTAT3. Hydrocortisone, inhibitors of receptor signaling, and suppression of metabolic function decreased SPREADs and local STAT3 activation.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines modulate SPREADs in human airway epithelial cells via both secreted EGFR and IL6R ligands. SPREADs correlate with changes in epithelial barrier permeability, implying a role for spatiotemporal ERK signaling in barrier homeostasis and dysfunction during inflammation. The involvement of SPREADs in airway inflammation suggests a novel signaling mechanism that could be exploited clinically to supplement corticosteroid treatment for asthma and COPD.
We demonstrate that proinflammatory cytokines cause spatiotemporally organized ERK signaling events called ""SPREADs"" in human airway epithelial cells, correlating with conditions that disrupt epithelial barrier function.",,"[{'lastname': 'DeCuzzi', 'firstname': 'Nicholaus L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Oberbauer', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chmiel', 'firstname': 'Kenneth J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pargett', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferguson', 'firstname': 'Justa M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'Devan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zeki', 'firstname': 'Amir A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Albeck', 'firstname': 'John G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': None}]"

Environmental management is essential in a complex chronic condition, as pollutant exposure can worsen symptoms and increase morbidity and mortality. We aimed to identify evidence that informs nursing interventions in promoting self-management of air quality in asthmatic people with COPD.
We conducted an integrative review in March of 2023. We searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Scopus, Web of Science, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Evidence-Based Practice Database, and Google Scholar. We included articles whose participants were adults with asthma, COPD, or both; the intervention was air quality management and the outcome of any exacerbations. We excluded editorials, letters, commentaries, opinion papers, position papers, study protocols, conference abstracts, and reviews. Data extraction and synthesis were performed, categorizing interventions according to nursing actions. Methodological quality assessment was conducted using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist tools. The review protocol was registered at Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5Y4KW).
We included five articles from different countries. The interventions promoting air quality self-management for individuals with asthma and COPD included vigilance interventions (health professional regular visits, assessment of symptoms), monitoring interventions (measurement of indoor and outdoor trigger factors), and educational interventions (air quality alerts, allergen avoidance). Policy interventions such as smoke-free policies and comprehensive strategies to improve air quality were also identified. These areas of focus represent critical components of nurses' interventions and can integrate the fundamental patterns of knowing in nursing. Although the studies reveal heterogeneous interventions and the methodological quality is variable, these interventions showed potential for preventing exacerbations, reducing emergency department visits, and minimizing hospitalizations.
The study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach involving nurses in multidisciplinary teams to air quality self-management. They can use these results to inform their interventions and ways of knowing, benefiting individuals with asthma and COPD. Further research is needed to expand the evidence base and refine these interventions.",,"[{'lastname': 'Sebastião', 'firstname': 'Bruna F', 'initials': 'BF', 'affiliation': 'Nursing School of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.\nHospital Center of Central Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Hortelão', 'firstname': 'Raquel M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Nursing School of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.\nCUF Tejo Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Granadas', 'firstname': 'Sara S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Nursing School of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.\nUniversity Hospital Center of Northern Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Faria', 'firstname': 'José M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Nursing School of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.\nHospital Center of Central Lisbon, Portugal.\nNursing Research, Innovation and Development Centre of Lisbon (CIDNUR), Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Pinto', 'firstname': 'Joana R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Nursing School of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.\nHospital Center of Central Lisbon, Portugal.\nNursing Research, Innovation and Development Centre of Lisbon (CIDNUR), Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Henriques', 'firstname': 'Helga Rafael', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': 'Nursing School of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.\nNursing Research, Innovation and Development Centre of Lisbon (CIDNUR), Lisbon, Portugal.'}]"

It is the most common chronic disease in children and represents one of the major causes for years lived with disability. Significant efforts are made by organizations such as WHO in improving the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of asthma. However asthma prevention has been less studied. Currently there is a concept of pre- diabetes which allows a reduction in full blown diabetes if diet and exercise are undertaken. Similar predictive states are found in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this paper we explore the possibilities for asthma prevention, both at population level and also investigate the possibility of defining a state of pre-asthma, in which intensive treatment could reduce progression to asthma.

Previous studies have suggested that shrimp has a higher threshold for reaction than other allergenic foods, suggesting it may be safe to directly administer maintenance doses of immunotherapy.
Children aged 3-17 years who had 1) skin prick test ≥3 mm and/or specific IgE level ≥0.35 kU/L and convincing objective IgE-mediated reaction to shrimp, or 2) no ingestion history and specific IgE level ≥5 kU/L, underwent a low-dose oral food challenge to 300 mg shrimp protein, with the goal of continuing daily ingestion of the 300 mg maintenance dose as oral immunotherapy.
Between January 2020 and April 2023, 17 children completed the low-dose oral food challenge. Nine (53%) tolerated this amount with no reaction, and 8 (47%) had a mild reaction (isolated oral pruritis or redness on chin). Sixteen (94%) continued maintenance low-dose oral immunotherapy eating 300 mg shrimp protein daily. None of the patients developed anaphylaxis related to the immunotherapy.
Our case series suggests that some shrimp allergic patients being considered for oral immunotherapy should be offered a low-dose oral food challenge, to potentially bypass the build-up phase of immunotherapy.","Our case series suggests that some shrimp allergic patients being considered for oral immunotherapy should be offered a low-dose oral food challenge, to potentially bypass the build-up phase of immunotherapy.","[{'lastname': 'Schoos', 'firstname': 'Ann-Marie M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'COPSAC, Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Slagelse Hospital, Slagelse, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Edmond S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': ""Division of Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nBritish Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Tiffany', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Division of Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nBritish Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Erdle', 'firstname': 'Stephanie C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': ""Division of Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nBritish Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Chomyn', 'firstname': 'Alanna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Division of Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Soller', 'firstname': 'Lianne', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Division of Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nBritish Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Mak', 'firstname': 'Raymond', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Division of Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.\nBritish Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""}]"

38351552,Impaired monocyte-derived dendritic cell phenotype in prostate cancer patients: A phenotypic comparison with healthy donors.,2024-02-14,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in immunity. Research on monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) cancer vaccines is in progress despite limited success in clinical trials. This study focuses on Mo-DCs generated from prostate cancer (PCA) patients, comparing them with DCs from healthy donors (HD-DCs).
Mo-DCs were isolated from PCA patient samples, and their phenotype was compared to HD-DCs. Key parameters included monocyte count, CD14 expression, and the levels of maturation markers (HLA-DR, CD80, CD86) were assessed.
PCA samples exhibited a significantly lower monocyte count and reduced CD14 expression compared to healthy samples (p ⟨ 0.0001). Additionally, PCA-DCs expressed significantly lower levels of maturation markers, including HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86, when compared to HD-DCs (p = 0.123, p = 0.884, and p = 0.309, respectively).
The limited success of DC vaccines could be attributed to impaired phenotypic characteristics. These observations suggest that suboptimal characteristics of Mo-DCs generated from cancer patient blood samples might contribute to the limited success of DC vaccines. Consequently, this study underscores the need for alternative strategies to enhance the features of Mo-DCs for more effective cancer immunotherapies.","The limited success of DC vaccines could be attributed to impaired phenotypic characteristics.

Here we introduce various bioinformatics methods and develop two models: an OVA/CFA-induced neutrophil asthma mouse model and an LPS-induced human bronchial epithelial cell damage model. Our objective is to investigate the molecular mechanisms, potential targets, and therapeutic strategies associated with asthma severity. Multiple bioinformatics methods identify meaningful differences in the degree of neutrophil infiltration in asthma patients with different severity. Then, PTPRC, TLR2, MMP9, FCGR3B, TYROBP, CXCR1, S100A12, FPR1, CCR1 and CXCR2 are identified as the hub genes. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of 10 hub genes is determined in vivo and in vitro models. Reperixin is identified as a pivotal drug targeting CXCR1, CXCR2 and MMP9. We further test the potential efficiency of Reperixin in 16HBE cells, and conclude that Reperixin can attenuate LPS-induced cellular damage and inhibit the expression of them.

We first confirmed that DEP induced cellular senescence in mouse lungs, and then that DEP-induced cellular senescence followed by intranasal instillation of a low-dose house dust mite (HDM) allergen resulted in murine asthma. Second, we examined age-dependent differential effects using 6-week-old (young) and 18-month-old mice (old), and tested whether the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays an important role in this process. Finally, we performed in vitro experiments using human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) originating from young and elderly adults to identify the underlying mechanisms.
DEP induced cellular senescence in the airway epithelial cells of young and old mice characterized by increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, S100A8/9, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expressions. DEP-induced cellular senescence with subsequent exposure to a low-dose HDM allergen resulted in asthma in young and old mice. Rapamycin (mTOR pathway inhibitor) administration before DEP instillation significantly attenuated these asthmatic features. In addition, after treatment with a low-dose HDM allergen, S100A9 and HMGB1 over-expressed HBEC originating from young and elderly adults greatly activated co-cultured monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs).

38350556,Three dimensional fibrotic extracellular matrix directs microenvironment fiber remodeling by fibroblasts.,2024-02-14,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), for which effective treatments are limited, results in excessive and disorganized deposition of aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM). An altered ECM microenvironment is postulated to contribute to disease progression through inducing profibrotic behavior of lung fibroblasts, the main producers and regulators of ECM. Here, we examined this hypothesis in a 3D in vitro model system by growing primary human lung fibroblasts in ECM-derived hydrogels from non-fibrotic (control) or IPF lung tissue. Using this model, we compared how control and IPF lung-derived fibroblasts responded in control and fibrotic microenvironments in a combinatorial manner. Culture of fibroblasts in fibrotic hydrogels did not alter in the overall amount of collagen or glycosaminoglycans but did cause a drastic change in fiber organization compared to culture in control hydrogels. High-density collagen percentage was increased by control fibroblasts in IPF hydrogels at day 7, but decreased at day 14. In contrast, IPF fibroblasts only decreased the high-density collagen percentage at day 14, which was accompanied by enhanced fiber alignment in IPF hydrogels. Similarly, stiffness of fibrotic hydrogels was increased only by control fibroblasts by day 14 while those of control hydrogels were not altered by fibroblasts. These data highlight how the ECM-remodeling responses of fibroblasts are influenced by the origin of both the cells and the ECM. Moreover, by showing how the 3D microenvironment plays a crucial role in directing cells, our study paves the way in guiding future investigations examining fibrotic processes with respect to ECM remodeling responses of fibroblasts. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we investigated the influence of the altered extracellular matrix (ECM) in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), using a 3D in vitro model system composed of ECM-derived hydrogels from both IPF and control lungs, seeded with human IPF and control lung fibroblasts. While our results indicated that fibrotic microenvironment did not change the overall collagen or glycosaminoglycan content, it resulted in a dramatically alteration of fiber organization and mechanical properties. Control fibroblasts responded differently from IPF fibroblasts, highlighting the unique instructive role of the fibrotic ECM and the interplay with fibroblast origin. These results underscore the importance of 3D microenvironments in guiding pro-fibrotic responses, offering potential insights for future IPF therapies as well as other fibrotic diseases and cancer.",,"[{'lastname': 'Nizamoglu', 'firstname': 'Mehmet', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, the Netherlands; University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen Research Institute for Asthma and COPD (GRIAC), Groningen, the Netherlands.

38350365,Evaluation of health status of transgender sex workers in Turkey: A qualitative study.,2024-02-14,"Sex workers can be disadvantaged in terms of overall health due to challenging living and working conditions. This research aimed to evaluate the health status and experiences related to sexually transmitted infections (STDs) of unregistered transgender sex workers in Turkey.
It employed a phenomenological qualitative research design. SITE: Data were collected in Istanbul between March 2021 and November 2021.
Data were collected through in-depth interviews involving 24 people (19 sex workers and 5 physicians).
Key statements were listed during data analysis, and clusters of meanings were formed based on these statements. The participants' statements were used for contextual and structural descriptions.
Sex workers suffer from chronic illnesses such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, allergic diseases, and neurological disorders. Among the health issues affecting them, the most notable ones are STDs, psychological problems, and the risk of suicide. Sex workers also face a dilemma between choosing public hospitals and private hospitals. Majority of sex workers undergo regular testing for STDs, with the frequency varying from person to person. Reasons for not undergoing regular testing include lack of social security coverage, financial constraints, lack of information, and feeling undervalued. Some individuals are being subjected to mandatory testing.
It is recommended that sex workers who seek and request healthcare services should be provided with detailed information and education, particularly regarding psychological problems and STDs.",,"[{'lastname': 'Onur Şimşek', 'firstname': 'Kadir', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Silopi District Health Directorate, 73400 Sirnak, Turkey.

This underscores the need for an accurate predictive system. Therefore, this study proposes a novel deep learning approach for forecasting Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) in the ICU.
We extracted 24,886 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III database which contains data from over 46 thousand patients, to train and test the model. The model proposed in this study, Transformer-based Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Sparse Time Series Forecasting (TDSTF), merges Transformer and diffusion models to forecast vital signs. The TDSTF model showed state-of-the-art performance in predicting vital signs in the ICU, outperforming other models' ability to predict distributions of vital signs and being more computationally efficient. The code is available at https://github.com/PingChang818/TDSTF.
The results of the study showed that TDSTF achieved a Standardized Average Continuous Ranked Probability Score (SACRPS) of 0.4438 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4168, an improvement of 18.9% and 34.3% over the best baseline model, respectively. The inference speed of TDSTF is more than 17 times faster than the best baseline model.
TDSTF is an effective and efficient solution for forecasting vital signs in the ICU, and it shows a significant improvement compared to other models in the field.","TDSTF is an effective and efficient solution for forecasting vital signs in the ICU, and it shows a significant improvement compared to other models in the field.","[{'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Ping', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Huayu', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Quan', 'firstname': 'Stuart F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': ""Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Departments of Medicine and Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Shuyang', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China; The Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Shanghai, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wung', 'firstname': 'Shu-Fen', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'Bio5 Institute, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Roveda', 'firstname': 'Janet', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Bio5 Institute, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Ao', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Bio5 Institute, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.

However, the simultaneous occurrence of ABPA and TPE is not often reported. We present the case of a young man with a history of asthma who was diagnosed with ABPA and TPE. Initially, the patient exhibited a partial response to treatment of ABPA, but persistent symptoms and eosinophilia led to suspicion and subsequent diagnosis of TPE.

Available studies only assessed age of severe RSV infection and asthma risk. The included studies used different age categories and outcome definitions, and were rated as having high risk of bias. Two studies had sample sizes of less than 300 and did not provide conclusive results related to age of RSV hospitalization and asthma risk. The other three studies reported RSV hospitalization between age 6 months and 23 months compared with age 0-6 months being associated with a higher odds ratio, hazard ratio, or incidence rate ratio of asthma diagnosis/hospitalization.

Do WTC workers with coexisting PTSD and asthma have a specific inflammatory pattern that underlies the relationship with increased asthma morbidity?
We collected data on a cohort of WTC workers with asthma recruited from the WTC Health Program. Diagnosis of PTSD was ascertained with a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders) and the severity of PTSD symptoms was assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5. We obtained blood and sputum samples to measure cytokines levels in study participants.
Of the 232 WTC workers with diagnosis of asthma in the study, 75 (32%) had PTSD. PTSD was significantly associated with worse asthma control (p = 0.002) and increased resource utilization (p = 0.0002). There was no significant association (p>0.05) between most blood or sputum cytokines with PTSD diagnosis or PCL-5 scores both in unadjusted and adjusted analyses.

38349560,Exploring Perceptions of Biologic Therapies: A Qualitative Study Among Canadians Living with Severe Asthma.,2024-02-13,"Biologic therapies have demonstrated benefits for individuals with severe asthma, including reduced daily symptoms and severe exacerbations. However, data describing patient perspectives on these treatments are limited. This study sought to understand the preferences and priorities of Canadians with severe asthma in the context of novel biologic treatment options.
Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted among Canadians with severe asthma from July to August 2022. Purposeful sampling included individuals with and without biologic therapy experience. All participants described daily life with severe asthma, experiences and priorities related to asthma treatment and their impressions of biologics. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to explore patterns in the data.
Among 18 individuals included, 10 were currently taking or had prior experience with biologic treatment for asthma. Those who had never been treated with biologics were unfamiliar with them, considering treatment, or believed that they may not be eligible. Four themes were developed to convey the perspectives of participants on biologics: (1) life-changing benefits, but not for all; (2) navigating barriers to being prescribed and remaining adherent to biologic treatments; (3) treatment administration preferences are not only about convenience; (4) concerns about safety and the unknown as a source of treatment hesitancy.
Findings suggest that the clinical benefits of biologics align with patient perceptions of achieving good asthma control. However, treatment gaps persist among individuals who do not experience a meaningful improvement in their asthma symptoms and those who face barriers accessing biologics. People with severe asthma attributed importance to greater availability of at-home treatment options, improved access to financial support to cover treatment costs and support to address safety concerns. This research provides insight into patient-based treatment priorities and preferences for biologics, which may help inform decision-making related to emerging therapies for severe asthma.
For people with severe asthma, biologics are a treatment option that can be taken in addition to their regular medication. In this study, we asked 18 Canadians with severe asthma about how having severe asthma affects their lives, their current and previous asthma treatments, and their views on biologics. Ten people in this study were currently taking or had previously taken biologics for severe asthma. We found that biologics can be life changing. Also, people with severe asthma can find it difficult to get on and stay on biologics. They would like financial and educational support when considering biologics and prefer to take biologics at home, if possible.

This review focuses on the possible factors that are associated with the transition from preschool wheezing to childhood asthma and highlights the significance of early-life environmental exposures during pregnancy and the first 6 months of life in shaping allergies and asthma. We observed a scarcity of studies investigating this subgroup, with most focusing on wheezing trajectories. We undertook a thorough investigation of diverse perinatal exposures that have the potential to impact this transition. These factors include maternal asthma, smoking during pregnancy, diet, prepregnancy weight, infant birthweight, gestational age, and breastfeeding. Although limited, studies do suggest that maternal asthma increases the likelihood of preschool wheeze in offspring that persists through childhood with potential asthma progression.

In Italy, the prevalence of allergic sensitization to cats and dogs is 16% and 9% respectively. The limited standardization of allergenic extracts, especially for dogs, emphasizes the importance of Component Resolved Diagnosis (CRD) for accurate diagnosis and subsequent prescription of allergen immunotherapy (AIT). However, this low standardization is the main factor contributing to the unsatisfactory clinical efficacy of traditional AIT, AIT with modified allergens, and intralymphatic allergen-specific immunotherapy (ILAIT). Emerging immunological approaches, particularly for controlling the primary cat allergen, show promise but are hindered by high costs (e.g., use of anti-Fel d 1 monoclonal antibodies in humans) or by exclusively targeting Fel d 1 produced by one's own animal (e.g., immunizing cats to induce neutralizing antibodies against Fel d 1 or including an egg product with anti Fel d 1 IgY antibodies in feline diet).

Respiratory syncytial virus infection is most common in children aged below 24 months. Neonates present with cough and fever. Respiratory syncytial virus-associated wheezing is seen in 20% infants during the first year of life of which 2-3% require hospitalization. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) gives fast results and has higher sensitivity compared with culture and rapid antigen tests and are not affected by passively administered antibody to RSV. Therapy for RSV infection of the LRT is mainly supportive, and preventive measures like good hygiene and isolation are the mainstay of management. Standard precautions, hand hygiene, breastfeeding and contact isolation should be followed for RSV-infected newborns. Recent AAP guidelines do not recommend pavilizumab prophylaxis for preterm infants born at 29-35 weeks without chronic lung disease, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease and coexisting conditions.

38347965,A Case of Long-Tract Ileocolic Intussusception Secondary to Well-Differentiated Cecal Adenocarcinoma.,2024-02-13,"Intussusception denotes the intricate phenomenon wherein one segment of the bowel undergoes invagination or telescoping into its contiguous distal segment. The ensuing invaginated segment may be propelled forward through peristaltic movements, potentially precipitating bowel obstruction or ischemia, culminating in necrosis of the affected bowel segment. Although the precise etiology of intussusception remains elusive, particularly in cases devoid of an identifiable lead point, dysrhythmic contractions and lymphoid hyperplasia have been implicated in the pathophysiology of this condition. We present the case of an 86-year-old African American female with a past medical history of hypertension and asthma who presented to our emergency room with a seven-day history of worsening abdominal. The pain was described as sharp and intermittent, and it would worsen with every meal or drink. A physical exam demonstrated the right lower quadrant with vague abdominal tenderness, especially below the umbilical region. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a long segment of ileocolic obstructing intussusception in the ascending colon, with a 2.6 cm solid mass serving as a lead point. Swift intervention ensued with an urgent exploratory laparotomy, culminating in a right hemicolectomy to excise the intussuscepted segment of the bowel. The pathological examination identified a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum, categorized as T1N0M0, with all 20 resected lymph nodes yielding negative results. This illustrative case presents a unique insight into a patient with ileocolic obstructing intussusception, caused by a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma acting as the lead point, a relatively uncommon occurrence in adults. Diagnosing intussusception in adults is challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms, which are similar to those of various other gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, it is crucial for medical providers to be acutely aware of the possibility that adenocarcinoma can trigger obstructing intussusception in various parts of the bowel.",,"[{'lastname': 'Ballan', 'firstname': 'Mohamad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Surgery, William Carey University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Hattiesburg, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aghababaei', 'firstname': 'Mahroo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Surgery, William Carey University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Hattiesburg, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chin', 'firstname': 'An Guo Michael', 'initials': 'AGM', 'affiliation': ""Surgery, St. John's Episcopal Hospital, Queens, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Dmitriy', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Surgery, St. John's Episcopal Hospital, Queens, USA.""}]"

This study aimed to examine how different vaccine characteristics affect public preferences for vaccines in New Zealand, what trade-offs they are willing to make between different vaccine characteristics, and how their preferences are affected by their vaccine-related conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 vaccination status.
An online discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to elicit individual preferences about vaccines using the 1000minds platform. Members of the general population of New Zealand aged ≥ 18 years were invited to complete the DCE. Participants were asked to indicate their preference between two options showing different combinations of vaccine characteristics. Data on sociodemographic characteristics were collected. Beliefs were measured using the vaccine conspiracy beliefs scale (VCBS) with scores ≥ 19 indicating strong vaccine-related conspiracy beliefs. The DCE was analysed using the PAPRIKA method (Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives) and preferences compared between respondents with high versus low VCBS scores and vaccinated versus unvaccinated respondents for COVID-19.
A total of 611 respondents from 15 regions completed the DCE. Mean (SD) age was 45.9 (14.7) years with most having had 2 or more doses of the coronavirus vaccine (86%). Mean (SD) VCBS score was 18.5 (12.4) indicating moderate vaccine-related conspiracy beliefs. Risk of severe adverse effects was the most highly valued vaccine characteristic, followed by vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection. Vaccine origin and route of administration were ranked least important. Respondents scoring high on the VCBS placed less value on the effectiveness of vaccines but greater value on development time and total number of doses (p < 0.001). COVID-19 unvaccinated respondents ranked development time and total number of doses more highly than those vaccinated respondents (p < 0.001).
Risk of severe adverse effects, vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection were rated by the New Zealand public as the top three most important vaccine characteristics. This information is important for informing public health messaging to promote vaccine uptake and inform vaccine decision-making.",,"[{'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Amy Hai Yan', 'initials': 'AHY', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, University of Auckland, Level 3, Building 505, 85 Park Road, Grafton, 1023, Auckland, New Zealand. a.chan@auckland.ac.nz.'}, {'lastname': 'Tao', 'firstname': 'Marvin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, University of Auckland, Building 505, 85 Park Road, Grafton, 1023, Auckland, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Marsh', 'firstname': 'Samantha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Population Health, University of Auckland, 85 Park Road, Grafton, 1023, Auckland, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Petousis-Harris', 'firstname': 'Helen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Population Health, University of Auckland, 85 Park Road, Grafton, 1023, Auckland, New Zealand.'}]"
38347197,Switching of biological therapy to dupilumab in comorbid patients with severe asthma and CRSwNP.,2024-02-13,"Nowadays, several efficacious biologic drugs are used for severe asthma with or without chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, it has been observed that not all comorbid patients (asthma/CRSwNP) receiving biologic treatment for asthma experience satisfactory control of both conditions equally.
We selected 20 patients who had both severe asthma and comorbid CRSwNP under biological treatment with benralizumab, omalizumab or mepolizumab with adequate control of asthma but inadequate control of nasal symptoms. Patients were switched to dupilumab and outcomes were evaluated at baseline (T0), at 3 months (T1), at 6 months (T2), at 12 months (T3) and finally at 18 months (T4). Data were collected at each time point including blood tests measuring eosinophil levels and total IgE, SNOT22, ACT, NPS score, rhinomanometry, olfactory testing, and nasal cytology.
The results showed an overall improvement in all the outcomes. Peripheral eosinophilia was observed consistently with existing literature. All patients registered an improvement in sinonasal outcomes, while only one patient had a worsening of asthma. Three patients interrupted the therapy due to various causes: poor asthma control, onset of psoriasis and thrombocytopenia.
The response to a biologic treatment for CRSwNP control may be heterogenous and it seems that patients may benefit from switching improving control in equal measure in the upper and lower airway. Further studies to explore the endotype/phenotype which best fits with each biologic are mandatory to personalize the therapy.",,"[{'lastname': 'Rosso', 'firstname': 'Cecilia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Otolaryngology Unit, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Sciences, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy. rosso.cecilia1@gmail.com.\nDepartment of Otolaryngology, San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, via di Rudinì 8, 20154, Milan, Italy. rosso.cecilia1@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'De Corso', 'firstname': 'Eugenio', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, A.

Freed of selection to digest nutrients, the airway microbiome underpins cognate management of mucosal immunity and pathogen resistance. We show here the initial results of systematic culture and whole-genome sequencing of the thoracic airway bacteria, identifying 52 novel species amongst 126 organisms that constitute 75% of commensals typically present in heathy individuals. Clinically relevant genes encode antimicrobial synthesis, adhesion and biofilm formation, immune modulation, iron utilisation, nitrous oxide (NO) metabolism and sphingolipid signalling. Using whole-genome content we identify dysbiotic features that may influence asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We match isolate gene content to transcripts and metabolites expressed late in airway epithelial differentiation, identifying pathways to sustain host interactions with microbiota. Our results provide a systematic basis for decrypting interactions between commensals, pathogens, and mucosa in lung diseases of global significance.",,"[{'lastname': 'Cuthbertson', 'firstname':

Prior studies have shown CD19 CAR-T can induce persistent B cell aplasia but preserve plasma cells for humoral response.
To assess immune repertoire and antibody titer status of CAR-T recipients METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of immune cell recovery and antibody titers to vaccines in anti-CD19 CAR-T recipients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester.
In our cohort of 95 CAR-T patients, almost half of the patients had low CD4 T and B cell counts prior to CAR-T and remained persistently low post CAR-T. Prior to CAR-T therapy, seronegative rate was lowest for tetanus and highest for pneumococcus irrespective of prior transplant status (within 2 years of CAR-T). At 3 months post CAR-T, overall seronegativity rates were similar when compared to pre-CAR-T levels for the prior transplant and no prior transplant group. For patients who received IVIG, loss of seropositivity was seen for hepatitis A (1/7,14%). No seroconversion was noted for pneumococcus. For patients who did not receive IVIG, loss of seropositivity was seen for pneumococcus (2/5, 40%) and hepatitis A (1/4, 25%).
CAR-T recipients commonly experience T cell and B cell lymphopenia and may not have adequate antibody titers against vaccine preventable diseases despite IVIG supplementation. There could be loss of antibody titers post CAR-T, thus highlighting need for re-vaccination. Additional study with long-term follow-up is needed to inform optimal timing of immunization post CAR-T.","CAR-T recipients commonly experience T cell and B cell lymphopenia and may not have adequate antibody titers against vaccine preventable diseases despite IVIG supplementation.

Such discordance can be obviated by combining both controller and reliever in the same inhaler. So called anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy comprises the use of a single inhaler containing an ICS such as budesonide (BUD) in conjunction with a reliever as either albuterol (ALB) or formoterol (FORM) ,to be used on demand with variable dosing driven by asthma symptoms in a flexible patient centred regimen. Global guidelines now support the use of BUD-ALB as AIR therapy to reduce exacerbations , either on its own in mild asthma or in conjunction with fixed dose maintenance ICS-long acting beta-agonist (LABA) in moderate to severe asthma . Using BUD-FORM on its own allows patients to seamlessly move in an intuitive flexible fashion between AIR or maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) , by stepping up and down the dosing escalator across a spectrum of asthma severities . Head to head clinical studies are indicated to compare BUD-FORM versus BUD-ALB as AIR in mild asthma ,and also BUD-FORM as MART versus BUD-ALB as AIR plus maintenance ICS-LABA in moderate to severe asthma.

38346176,Activation of Notch1-GATA3 pathway in asthma bronchial epithelial cells induced by acute PM2.5 exposure and the potential protective role of microRNA-139-5p.,2024-02-12,"PM2.5 is closed linked to asthma exacerbation. The Notch1 pathway acts as an important pathway, ultimately inducing T-helper cells that express GATA3 and its corresponding Th2 cytokines. The regulatory effects of miR-139-5p on the Notch1 pathway have been indicated in cancer. However, studies on miR-139-5p have not applied asthma related models. The role of miR-139-5p and its regulatory effects on the Notch1-GATA3 pathway in asthma exacerbation induced by acute PM2.5 exposure has not been elucidated. We hypothesize that acute PM2.5 exposure induces asthma exacerbation by regulating the expression of miR-139-5p and activating the Notch1-GATA3 pathway.
We first employed Diseased Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells-Asthma cells to establish an in vitro model of acute exposure to PM2.5, and explored the relationship between the different concentrations and durations of acute PM2.5 exposure and the activation of Notch1-GATA3 pathway. We investigated the protein and mRNA expression changes of Notch1, upstream Jagged1, downstream GATA3, as well as the regulatory effect of miR-139-5p involved in it.
The miR-139-5p expression increased within 24 hours of PM2.5 exposure. However, if PM2.5 exposure was sustained, miR-139-5p expression turned to decrease, accompanied by upregulations of the mRNA and protein expression of Notch1-GATA3 pathway. Overexpression of miR-139-5p blocked Notch1-GATA3 pathway activation induced by acute PM2.5 exposure.
Acute PM2.5 exposure can activate Notch1-GATA3 pathway in asthma bronchial epithelial cells model, which might be involved in PM2.5-induced asthma exacerbation. miR-139-5p has a potential protective role of inhibiting PM2.5-induced asthma airway inflammation by targeting Notch1.","Acute PM2.5 exposure can activate Notch1-GATA3 pathway in asthma bronchial epithelial cells model, which might be involved in PM2.5-induced asthma exacerbation. miR-139-5p has a potential protective role of inhibiting PM2.5-induced asthma airway inflammation by targeting Notch1.","[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Junjun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.\nDepartment of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yunxia', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Zhou', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.'}]"
38345634,Anti-CD20 treatment attenuates Th2 cell responses: implications for the role of lung follicular mature B cells in the asthmatic mice.,2024-02-12,"B cells were believed to act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to promote T helper type 2 (Th2) cell responses. However, the role of lung B cells and its subpopulations in Th2 cell responses in asthma remains unclear.
We leveraged an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment that has been shown to selectively deplete B cells in mice and investigated whether this treatment modulates Th2 cell responses and this modulation is related to lung follicular mature (FM) B cells in a murine model of asthma.
We used a house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma mouse model and found that anti-CD20 mAb treatment attenuates Th2 cell responses. Meanwhile, anti-CD20 mAb treatment did dramatically reduce the number of B cells, especially FM B cells in the lungs, but did not impact the frequency of other immune cell types, including lung T cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and regulatory T cells in wild-type mice. Moreover, we found that the suppressive effect of anti-CD20 mAb treatment on Th2 cell responses could be reversed upon adoptive transfer of lung FM B cells, but not lung CD19
These findings reveal that anti-CD20 mAb treatment alleviates Th2 cell responses, possibly by depleting lung FM B cells in a Th2-driven asthma model. This implies a potential therapeutic approach for asthma treatment through the targeting of lung FM B cells.",,"[{'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Jilong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Jingling', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Qibin', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ni', 'firstname': 'Haiyang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Sisi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Hong', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ding', 'firstname': 'Xuhong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Hongying', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yaqing', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, Hubei, China. 15392885220@163.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Nie', 'firstname': 'Hanxiang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, China. nhxiang@whu.edu.cn.'}]"

Scotland.
The study involved 5.4 million residents in Scotland.
Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between risk factors and ARI hospitalisation.
Between 1 September 2022 and 31 January 2023, there were 22,284 (10.9% of 203,549 with any emergency hospitalisation) ARI hospitalisations (1759 in children and 20,525 in adults) in Scotland. Compared with the reference group of children aged 6-17 years, the risk of ARI hospitalisation was higher in children aged 3-5 years (aHR = 4.55; 95% CI: 4.11-5.04). Compared with those aged 25-29 years, the risk of ARI hospitalisation was highest among the oldest adults aged ≥80 years (aHR = 7.86; 95% CI: 7.06-8.76). Adults from more deprived areas (most deprived vs. least deprived, aHR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.57-1.72), with existing health conditions (≥5 vs. 0 health conditions, aHR = 4.84; 95% CI: 4.53-5.18) or with history of all-cause emergency admissions (≥6 vs. 0 previous emergency admissions, aHR = 7.53; 95% CI: 5.48-10.35) were at a higher risk of ARI hospitalisations. The risk increased by the number of existing health conditions and previous emergency admission. Similar associations were seen in children.

The transplantation process consists of two distinct stages: donor harvest and subsequent implantation into the recipient. The method has been successfully mastered, and with several months of sufficient training, a skilled practitioner can perform the procedure in approximately 90 min from skin-to-skin. Surprisingly, once individuals overcome the initial learning curve, the survival rate during the perioperative period approaches nearly 100%. The mouse model allows for the use of multiple commercially available transgenic and mutant strains of mice, enabling the study of tolerance and rejection.

Saudi Arabia, with its unique climatic conditions and cultural practices, has been under scrutiny regarding the prevalence of this deficiency, especially among children and adolescents. This systematic review aimed to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among children and adolescents in Saudi Arabia by compiling and analyzing various studies to offer a comprehensive view of the situation. The comprehensive web search encompassed a range of databases, including Google Scholar and PubMed, to gather studies published between 2012 and 2023. An analysis was conducted on seven studies, totaling 2,429 participants, with each study focusing on various aspects, regions, and cohorts within Saudi Arabia. These studies employed different methodologies, ranging from cross-sectional surveys to randomized clinical trials. The review unveiled an alarming prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the studied population. On average, around 81.1% of children and adolescents showcased inadequate vitamin D levels. Specific vulnerable groups, such as those with Type 1 diabetes mellitus or asthma, had pronounced deficiencies. Factors influencing these levels ranged from dietary habits, sun exposure, physical activity, and socioeconomic parameters. The compelling evidence from the studies underscores a consistent health issue among the pediatric population in Saudi Arabia that the overwhelming majority of Saudi children and adolescents lack adequate vitamin D. Addressing this widespread deficiency needs a multifaceted approach. Implementing policies that support vitamin D food fortification, encouraging routine screenings, and launching public awareness campaigns about safe sun exposure and diet can play a transformative role in this health crisis.",,"[{'lastname': 'Alhamed', 'firstname': 'Meath S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Family Medicine, King Abdulaziz Hospital, Al-Mubarraz, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alharbi', 'firstname': 'Fahad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Family Medicine, King Abdulaziz Hospital, Al-Mubarraz, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Al Joher', 'firstname': 'Abdullatif', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Family Medicine, King Abdulaziz Hospital, Al-Mubarraz, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Dhahry', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'General Practice, Al Yamamah Hospital, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Fallatah', 'firstname': 'Albandari A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Al Yamamah Hospital, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alanazi', 'firstname': 'Omar H', 'initials': 'OH', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Al Yamamah Hospital, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Almutiri', 'firstname': 'Jawaher M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Paediatrics, Al Yamamah Hospital, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Albaradie', 'firstname': 'Saida S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Al Yamamah Hospital, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Al Enezi', 'firstname': 'Budoor Aziz A', 'initials': 'BAA', 'affiliation': 'Nursing, Al Yamamah Hospital, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Albishi', 'firstname': 'Mashail S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Nursing, Al Yamamah Hospital, Riyadh, SAU.'}]"

38344153,Evaluating the Feasibility of a Community Pharmacy-Delivered Behaviour Change Intervention to Reduce Reliever Reliance in Asthma.,2024-02-12,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a community pharmacy-delivered intervention to shift patients' beliefs about short-acting beta
This non-randomized, before-and-after feasibility study enrolled participants with asthma from four community pharmacies in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and above and were prescribed a SABA for their asthma. The intervention included the SABA reliance questionnaire to determine the degree of SABA reliance, verbal discussions with pharmacists personalised according to the degree of SABA reliance identified, and referral to general practitioners as appropriate.
Of the 44 patients who consented into the study, 19 were in the control group and 16 in the intervention group. Recruitment and retention were modest, with 10 control and five intervention participants completing the 90-day follow-up. Although not statistically significant, preliminary results indicated reduced SABA reliance and increased ICS adherence in the intervention group, and reduced SABA refill. Feedback showed that 78% of intervention participants found the information easy to understand, and 56% expressed intent to consult their general practitioners. Pharmacy staff found the intervention feasible but noted time constraints as a barrier to intervention delivery.
The study demonstrates that a community pharmacy-delivered intervention is feasible and acceptable to both patients and pharmacists.

38343891,TIMP-1 and its potential diagnostic and prognostic value in pulmonary diseases.,2024-02-12,"Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) have caught the attention of many scientists due to their role in various physiological and pathological processes. TIMP-1, 2, 3, and 4 are known members of the TIMPs family. TIMPs exert their biological effects by, but are not limited to, inhibiting the activity of metalloproteases (MMPs). The balance between MMPs and TIMPs is critical for maintaining homeostasis of the extracellular matrix (ECM), while the imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs can lead to pathological changes, such as cancer. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of TIMP-1 in several pulmonary diseases namely, acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Considering the potential of TIMP-1 serving as a non-invasive diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker, we also reviewed the circulating TIMP-1 levels in translational and clinical studies.",,"[{'lastname': 'Almuntashiri', 'firstname': 'Sultan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.\nDepartment of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Hail, Hail 55473, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alhumaid', 'firstname': 'Abdullah', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.\nDepartment of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Hail, Hail 55473, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Yin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Yohan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dutta', 'firstname': 'Saugata', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Khilji', 'firstname': 'Ohmed', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Duo', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.'}]"

While both the incidence and mortality rates have shown a decline, older individuals with asthma exhibit not just more severe symptoms but also demonstrate an elevated mortality rate. This phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of chronic comorbidities that exert an influence on clinical outcomes among adult patients with asthma. This review aims to present various aspects of asthma comprehensively, including the prevalence, incidence, mortality rates, and causes of death in adult patients with asthma. Additionally, this review delves into the impact of chronic comorbidities that contribute to the morbidity and mortality of patients with asthma on a global scale, encompassing conditions such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, lung cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, concerning asthma. Furthermore, the manuscript reviews the distinctions between asthma and asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap and adds perspective on asthma as an occupational lung disease.

38343493,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Among Users of Primary Health Care Facilities in Morocco.,2024-02-12,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem. In Morocco, few studies have focused on COPD in primary health care facilities, whose main mission is prevention. The aim of our work is thus to assess the prevalence of COPD and to study the factors associated with this silent disease among users of health care facilities in Morocco.
This is a cross-sectional observational study of participants aged 40 and over. Data were collected by questionnaire. Pulmonary function testing was conducted using a spirometer before and after administration of a bronchodilator. COPD was defined as fixed ratio of the post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second / forced vital capacity less than 0.7. Logistic regression models were applied to define factors associated with COPD.
From 550 participants aged 40 and over, we selected only 477 patients with exploitable spirometry results for inclusion in the final analysis. The mean age of participants was 54.91±11.92 years, and the female/male ratio was 1.59. The prevalence of COPD was 6.7% (95% CI; 4.6 to 9.3%), and was higher in men than in women (11.4% vs 3.8%, p=0.002). The prevalence of COPD increased significantly with age, from 3.3% in those aged 40 to 49 to 16.9% in those aged 70 and over (p=0.001). Current smokers had a higher prevalence of COPD than former and never smokers. Age, smoking, asthma diagnosis and childhood hospitalization for lung disease were risk factors associated with the development of COPD. Only 6.25% of participants identified as having COPD had previously been diagnosed with COPD.
COPD remains largely under-diagnosed among primary care consultants in Morocco. Efforts for early detection and promotion of prevention of the main risk factors need to be intensified in order to reduce the burden of this silent pathology on a national scale.",COPD remains largely under-diagnosed among primary care consultants in Morocco.

The increase of allergic diseases in the elderly is also related to additional factors, such as various comorbidities that may interfere with the development and the type of allergic reactions. Immunosenescence plays a central role in these reactions, altering microbiota responses and triggering inflammageing.

However, the relationship between the upper and lower airway microbiome remains unclear.
Sinus and lung brushes were collected from 29 CRS participants undergoing sinus surgery. DNA was extracted and submitted for 16s rRNA microbiome sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity metrics, taxonomic composition, and differences between individual taxa were compared for paired sinus and bronchial samples.
Twenty-three out of 29 participants had sufficient samples for analysis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 51.59 (14.57) years, and 10 (44%) patients were female. Twelve (52%) patients had comorbid asthma. Sinus brushes had significantly higher alpha diversity indexes (Shannon and Faith) compared to bronchial brushes (p < 0.001). Beta diversity metrics were significantly different between the sinus and bronchial samples. Principal coordinate analysis showed no clustering of paired nasal and bronchial samples. Sinus brushes had significantly more Lawsonella, Corynebacterium, and Staphylococcus compared to bronchia brushes, while the latter were enriched in Tropheryma and Sphingomonas, among others (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p < 0.01). Finally, CRS patients with comorbid asthma had significantly higher Pseudomonas and Peptoniphilus in sinus brushes and lower Prevotella in bronchial brushes when compared to non-asthmatics (FDR-adjusted p < 0.01).

38342758,A cross talk between microbial metabolites and host immunity: Its relevance for allergic diseases.,2024-02-12,"Allergic diseases, including respiratory and food allergies, as well as allergic skin conditions have surged in prevalence in recent decades. In allergic diseases, the gut microbiome is dysbiotic, with reduced diversity of beneficial bacteria and increased abundance of potential pathogens. Research findings suggest that the microbiome, which is highly influenced by environmental and dietary factors, plays a central role in the development, progression, and severity of allergic diseases. The microbiome generates metabolites, which can regulate many of the host's cellular metabolic processes and host immune responses.
Our goal is to provide a narrative and comprehensive literature review of the mechanisms through which microbial metabolites regulate host immune function and immune metabolism both in homeostasis and in the context of allergic diseases.
We describe key microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, bile acids and polyamines, elucidating their mechanisms of action, cellular targets and their roles in regulating metabolism within innate and adaptive immune cells. Furthermore, we characterize the role of bacterial metabolites in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases including allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis and food allergy.

Thromboinflammation (the interplay between coagulation and inflammation) is probably involved in these events. Extracellular vesicles (EV) increase during AE-COPD, but their role in thromboinflammation in COPD is still unknown. We investigated EV-associated prothrombotic and proinflammatory activity in COPD.
Patients with AE-COPD, stable COPD (sCOPD) and age- and sex-matched subjects (controls) were enrolled. AE-COPD patients were evaluated at hospital admission and 8 weeks after discharge (recovery; longitudinal arm). In a cross-sectional arm, AE-COPD were compared with sCOPD and controls. EV-mediated prothrombotic activity was tested by measuring the concentration of EV-associated phosphatidylserine, as assessed by a prothrombinase assay, and tissue factor, as assessed by a modified one-stage clotting assay (EV-PS and EV-TF, respectively). Synthesis of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and C-C motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL-2) by cells of the human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE incubated with patients' EV was used to measure EV-mediated proinflammatory activity.
Twenty-five AE-COPD (median age [interquartile range] 74.0 [14.0] years), 31 sCOPD (75.0 [9.5] years) and 12 control (67.0 [3.5] years) subjects were enrolled. In the longitudinal arm, EV-PS, EV-TF, IL-8 and CCL-2 levels were all significantly higher at hospital admission than at recovery. Similarly, in the cross-sectional arm, EV-PS, EV-TF and cytokines synthesis were significantly higher in AE-COPD than in sCOPD and controls.

Three new potentially disease causing variants linked to HAE-nC1-INH were identified (c.529+4A&gt;G:FXII; Cys248*:Kininogen-1; Arg261His:Plasminogen). The HAE-FXII cohort included 82% females and 71.8% symptomatic patients. Penetrance rate was significantly higher in females (81.3% vs 28.6; p=0.012). A hormonal influence was observed in 96.2% of the symptomatic females, although 62.5% remained symptomatic after oral estrogens withdrawal. Trauma and dental procedures were frequent triggers (82.6% and 45.5%, respectively). Main locations were facial (described by 96%), lips (82.1%) and eyelids (64.3%). One patient reported erythema marginatum as prodrome. Plasma derived C1-INH was effective as short-term prophylaxis in all treated patients, but only in 80% as on demand treatment.

The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of asthma were poorly understood. This study aims to explore potential biomarkers associated with asthma and analyze the pathological role of immune cell infiltration in the disease.
The gene expression profiles of induced sputum were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus datasets (GSE76262 and GSE137268) and were combined for analysis. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) was identified as the core gene by the intersection of two different machine learning algorithms, namely, least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) regression and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and the top 10 core networks based on Cytohubba. CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze the difference of immune cell infiltration between asthma and healthy control groups. Finally, the expression level of TLR7 was validated in induced sputum samples of patients with asthma.
A total of 320 differential expression genes between the asthma and healthy control groups were screened, including 184 upregulated genes and 136 downregulated genes. TLR7 was identified as the core gene after combining the results of LASSO regression, SVM-RFE algorithm, and top 10 hub genes. Significant differences were observed in the distribution of 13 out of 22 infiltrating immune cells in asthma. TLR7 was found to be closely related to the level of several infiltrating immune cells. TLR7 mRNA levels were downregulated in asthmatic patients compared with healthy controls (p = 0.0049). The area under the curve of TLR7 for the diagnosis of asthma was 0.7674 (95% CI 0.631-0.904, p = 0.006). Moreover, TLR7 mRNA levels were negatively correlated with exhaled nitric oxide fraction (r = - 0.3268, p = 0.0347) and the percentage of peripheral blood eosinophils (%) (r = - 0.3472, p = 0.041), and positively correlated with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (% predicted) (r = 0.3960, p = 0.0071) and FEV

38341371,Analysis of the relationship between comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and clinical outcomes in patients with asthma in Japan.,2024-02-11,"Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are prevalent chronic respiratory disorders, which often coexist and interact with each other. Obesity is an important risk factor shared by them. The rate of obesity is lower in Japan versus Western countries. Hence, the co-existence of asthma and OSA has not been investigated in Japan.
Ninety-seven outpatients with asthma were recruited. Patients wore a portable monitor for sleep study. Background data, pulmonary function, blood tests, and patient-reported outcomes including gastroesophageal reflux disease, sleepiness, sleep quality, asthma control, cough and respiratory symptoms, and health status, were assessed.
Of the patients, 19 (19.6 %), 40 (41.2 %), 24 (24.7 %), and 14 (14.4 %) were classified into non-, mild, moderate, and severe OSA groups. Non-OSA patients were younger than those in other groups (p < 0.05). The BMI of patients with moderate and severe OSA, was higher than that of non-OSA patients (p < 0.05). Pulmonary function, FeNO, serum IgE, and the number of peripheral eosinophils were not significantly different between groups. Nonetheless, compared with the other groups, treatment step was the highest, and the Asthma Control Test, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test, and Asthma Health Questionnaire-33 yielded worst scores in the severe OSA group, and predicted the severe OSA after adjustment by BMI.
Moderate and severe OSA are highly prevalent among patients with asthma in Japan. Pulmonary function did not differ between groups. However, patients with asthma and severe OSA were linked to more asthma treatment, worse asthma control, more symptoms and cough, and worse health status.",,"[{'lastname': 'Ikegami-Tanaka', 'firstname': 'Hitomi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yasokawa', 'firstname': 'Naoya', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kurose', 'firstname': 'Koji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tajima', 'firstname': 'Shonosuke', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Abe', 'firstname': 'Masaaki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Katoh', 'firstname': 'Shigeki', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kobashi', 'firstname': 'Yoshihiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Oga', 'firstname': 'Toru', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.

38341269,Fungal thermotolerance revisited and why climate change is unlikely to be supercharging pathogenic fungi (yet).,2024-02-11,"Thermotolerance has been viewed as an uncommon characteristic among the fungi and one of the reasons that less than 1% of the described species operate as opportunistic pathogens of humans. Growth at 37°C is certainly a requirement for a fungus that invades the body core, but tens of thousands of nonpathogenic species are also able to grow at this temperature. Ergo, body temperature does not serve as a thermal barrier to the development of infections by many harmless fungi. The absence of other virulence factors must be more demanding. This observation raises questions about the hypothetical links between climate change and the increasing number of life-threatening human mycoses. Given the widespread distribution of fungal thermotolerance and the 1°C (2°F) increase in global temperature over the last 140 years it seems unlikely that the warming climate has driven the evolution of more virulent strains of fungi. More compelling explanations for the changes in the behavior of fungi as disease agents include their adaptation to the widening use of azole antifungals in hospitals and the wholesale application of millions of tons of the same class of heterocyclic chemicals in agriculture. On the other hand, climate change is having a significant effect on the spread of human mycoses by extending the geographical range of pathogenic fungi. A related increase in fungal asthma caused by spore inhalation is another likely consequence of planetary change.",,"[{'lastname': 'Money', 'firstname': 'Nicholas P', 'initials': 'NP', 'affiliation': 'Western Program and Department of Biology, Miami University, Oxford, OH, 45056, USA.

The recent development of targeted asthma biologics has validated the power of basic research to discover new molecules amenable to therapeutic intervention. Advances in high throughput sequencing are providing a wealth of ""-omic"" data about genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of asthma, as well as new cellular interacting networks and potential endotypes in asthma. Airway epithelial cells have emerged not only as key sensors of the outside environment, but also as central drivers of dysregulated mucosal immune responses in asthma. Emerging data suggest that the airway epithelium in asthma remembers prior encounters with environmental exposures, resulting in potentially long-lasting changes in structure and metabolism that render asthmatics susceptible to subsequent exposures. Here we summarize recent insights into asthma biology, focusing on studies using human cells or tissue published in the past two years. Studies are organized thematically into six content areas to draw connections and spur future research (Genetics and Epigenetics, Prenatal and Early Life Origins, Microbiome, Immune and Inflammatory Pathways, Asthma Endotypes and Biomarkers, and Lung Structural Alterations). We highlight recent studies on airway epithelial dysfunction and response to viral infections and conclude with a framework for considering how bidirectional interactions between alterations in airway structure and mucosal immunity can lead to sustained lung dysfunction in asthma.",,"[{'lastname': 'Georas', 'firstname': 'Steve N', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Khurana', 'firstname': 'Sandhya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]"
38341139,"The Relationship Between Allergic Rhinitis, Asthma and Cardiovascular Disease in the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS), 1999-2018.",2024-02-11,"Atopic disease has been associated with immune dysregulation and chronic inflammation, but current practice guideline recommendations do not include the evaluation of inflammatory outcomes among patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.
This study investigates the relationship between asthma, allergic rhinitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) using data from the US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) between 1999-2018.
We used data from adults in the NHIS (n = 603,140, representing a population of 225,483,286). Exposures were physician-diagnosed asthma (lifetime/past-year) and allergic rhinitis (past-year). Outcomes were physician-diagnosed heart disease: coronary heart disease (CHD), angina, heart-attack, and non-specific ""heart-condition"" (all lifetime). We used survey-weighted descriptive analysis and logistic regression adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors.
11.44% reported at least one heart condition, with CHD the most prevalent (4.27%) across 20 years of pooled data. Asthma and rhinitis were associated with higher CVD in all bivariate analyses. Specifically, lifetime asthma was associated with increased odds of CHD, OR=1.36 (1.29, 1.42), with stronger effects observed for a past-year asthma-attack, OR= 1.66 (1.55, 1.80). The strongest effect of all was observed in those with a past-year asthma attack having increased odds of angina, OR=2.42 (2.24, 2.63). Allergic rhinitis was independently associated with increased odds of CHD (OR=1.25, 1.18-1.28).
Asthma and allergic rhinitis are risk factors for all types of CVD in this nationally representative study covering a two-decade period in the US. Clinicians should consider screening patients with severe and/or uncontrolled asthma and allergic rhinitis early for CVD, particularly angina and CHD. Future studies are warranted to explore the immunological milieu in these patients and identify therapeutic targets.",,"[{'lastname': 'Nagarajan', 'firstname': 'Sairaman', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Allergy and Asthma Research, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, NY; Department of Country Readiness Strengthening, World Health Emergencies Programme, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.

38341029,"Intrinsic risk factors for alpha-gal syndrome in a case-control study, 2019-2020.",2024-02-11,"Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is an allergy to galactose-α-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), a carbohydrate found in most mammals. Evidence indicates that AGS develops following a tick bite, and in the United States, AGS is most associated with bites from Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick); however, not all persons bitten by ticks develop clinical AGS.
This study investigated intrinsic risk factors associated with the development of AGS.
We performed a case-control study among adults presenting for diagnosis or management of AGS at an allergy clinic in North Carolina during 2019-2020 and compared them to controls enrolled from two nearby internal medicine clinics. A questionnaire gathered epidemiologic and tick exposure data and blood was obtained for alpha-gal specific IgE (sIgE) and other testing.
The 82 enrolled case patients and 191 controls did not differ significantly by age or sex. Case patients were more likely than controls to have A or O blood types (non-B-antigen), have experienced childhood allergies, and have a family history of AGS and other food allergies. Case patients were also more likely to report experiencing long healing times for insect bites or stings and a family history of allergy to stinging or biting insects.
This study suggests that intrinsic factors contribute to risk of developing AGS. Some traits are genetic, but common behaviors among households and family units likely also contribute. Identification of these risk factors can inform personal risk, aid healthcare providers in understanding susceptible populations, and contribute to ongoing understanding of AGS epidemiology.","This study suggests that intrinsic factors contribute to risk of developing AGS.

The aims were to investigate the relation between infants' and maternal plasma SCFAs, as well as SCFAs in mother's milk, and relate SCFA concentrations in infant plasma to subsequent sensitisation and atopic disease.
Infant plasma (N = 148) and corresponding mother's milk and plasma were collected four months postpartum. Nine SCFA (formic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, succinic, valeric, isovaleric, and caproic acid) were analysed by UPLC-MS. At 12 months of age, atopic disease was diagnosed by a pediatric allergologist, and sensitisation was measured by skin prick test. All families participated in the Swedish birth cohort NICE (Nutritional impact on Immunological maturation during Childhood in relation to the Environment).
Infants with sensitisation, atopic eczema, or food allergy had significantly lower concentrations of five, three, and two SCFAs, respectively, in plasma at four months. Logistic regressions models showed significant negative associations between formic, succinic, and caproic acid and sensitisation [OR
Butyric and caproic acid might be actively transported into breast milk to meet the needs of the infant, although mechanistic studies are needed to confirm this. The negative associations between certain SCFAs on sensitisation and atopic disease adds to prior evidence regarding their immunoregulatory potential.

Peripheral eosinophil blood count (EBC) has been proposed as a potential indicator for future asthma development. This review by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Preschool Wheeze Task Force aimed to provide systematic evidence for the association between increased EBC and the risk of future asthma, as well as to identify potential cutoff values. In February 2023, a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify studies comparing EBCs in preschool children with wheezing who continued to wheeze later in life and those who did not. Included observational studies focused on children aged <6 years with a wheezing disorder, assessment of their EBCs, and subsequent asthma status. No language or publication date restrictions were applied. Among the initial 3394 studies screened, 10 were included in the final analysis, involving 1225 patients. The data from these studies demonstrated that high EBC in preschool children with wheezing is associated with future asthma development, with odds ratios of 1.90 (95% CI: 0.45-7.98, p = .38), 2.87 (95% CI: 1.38-5.95, p < .05), and 3.38 (95% CI: 1.72-6.64, p < .05) for cutoff values in the <300, 300-449, and ≥450 cells/μL ranges, respectively. Defining a specific cutoff point for an elevated EBC lacks consistency, but children with EBC >300 cells/μL are at increased risk of asthma.

38339221,Genetic Diversity in Bronchial Asthma Susceptibility: Exploring the Role of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphisms in Varied Geographic Contexts.,2024-02-10,"Bronchial asthma (BA) exhibits varying prevalence across global populations, prompting a comprehensive investigation into genetic and environmental determinants. Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator capable of suppressing inflammatory signals in several cell types involved in the asthmatic response; it exerts effects on the immune system by binding to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). VDR gene genetic variations are affecting serum vitamin D levels with a possible role in the BA risk.

38339210,"Mucus Structure, Viscoelastic Properties, and Composition in Chronic Respiratory Diseases.",2024-02-10,"The respiratory mucus, a viscoelastic gel, effectuates a primary line of the airway defense when operated by the mucociliary clearance. In chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), the mucus is overproduced and its solid content augments, changing its structure and viscoelastic properties and determining a derangement of essential defense mechanisms against opportunistic microbial (virus and bacteria) pathogens. This ensues in damaging of the airways, leading to a vicious cycle of obstruction and infection responsible for the harsh clinical evolution of these CRDs. Here, we review the essential features of normal and pathological mucus (i.e., sputum in CF, COPD, and asthma), i.e., mucin content, structure (mesh size), micro/macro-rheology, pH, and osmotic pressure, ending with the awareness that sputum biomarkers (mucins, inflammatory proteins and peptides, and metabolites) might serve to indicate acute exacerbation and response to therapies. There are some indications that old and novel treatments may change the structure, viscoelastic properties, and biomarker content of sputum; however, a wealth of work is still needed to embrace these measures as correlates of disease severity in association with (or even as substitutes of) pulmonary functional tests.",,"[{'lastname': 'Abrami', 'firstname': 'Michela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Via Valerio 6/A, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Biasin', 'firstname': 'Alice', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste, Via Valerio 6/A, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Tescione', 'firstname': 'Fabiana', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Polymers, Composites and Biomaterials, National Research Council of Italy, P.le E.

38337448,Eosinophilic Patterns in Patients with Seasonal Allergy Affected by Bronchial Asthma and Rhinitis/Rhinosinusitis: Efficacy of Benralizumab in Patients with the Persistent Pattern.,2024-02-10,"Eosinophilia can be influenced by multiple factors. This study aims to set a protocol for monitoring blood absolute eosinophil count (AEC) in patients with seasonal allergy affected by bronchial asthma (BA), allergic rhinitis (AR), or chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyposis (CRSw/sNP).
We planned a total of four annual blood samples to measure AEC in- and out-seasonal pollen exposure (i.e., one measurement every three months for one year).
We identified two distinct groups of patients (non-eosinophilic and eosinophilic). Patients in the eosinophilic group presented with four different patterns (episodic, transient, floating, and persistent). Most patients with episodic, transient, and floating patterns were affected by mild allergy and the increase in eosinophils was related to allergen exposure. In contrast, patients with the persistent pattern mostly presented with more severe allergy (i.e., severe BA and relapsing CRSwNP) and the eosinophilia was unrelated to allergen exposure. The subgroup of patients with severe BA, relapsing CRSwNP, and persistent eosinophilc pattern were treated with benralizumab, which induced a noteworthy improvement in both severe BA and CRSwNP.
Multiple AEC measurements in patients with seasonal allergy can better reflect patient's eosinophilic status and help define the relationship of AEC enhancement with allergen exposure.",,"[{'lastname': ""D'Aiuto"", 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mormile', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Granata', 'firstname': 'Francescopaolo', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Romano', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Head and Neck Section, Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive and Odontostomatological Science, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Della Casa', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Onofrio"", 'firstname': 'Caterina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Post-Graduate Program in Clinical Immunology and Allergy, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Marzio', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Post-Graduate Program in Clinical Immunology and Allergy, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mignogna', 'firstname': 'Gabriele', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Post-Graduate Program in Clinical Immunology and Allergy, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Califano', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Head and Neck Section, Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive and Odontostomatological Science, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'de Paulis', 'firstname': 'Amato', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.\nCenter for Basic and Clinical Immunology Research (CISI), WAO Center of Excellence, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rossi', 'firstname': 'Francesca Wanda', 'initials': 'FW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.\nCenter for Basic and Clinical Immunology Research (CISI), WAO Center of Excellence, University of Naples Federico II, 80131 Naples, Italy.'}]"

To characterize cellular and T cell profiles in the large airways of young adults with a history of BPD.
Forty-three young adults born prematurely (preterm (n = 20), BPD (n = 23)) and 45 full-term-born (asthma (n = 23), healthy (n = 22)) underwent lung function measurements, and bronchoscopy with large airway bronchial wash (BW). T-cells subsets in BW were analyzed by immunocytochemistry.
The proportions of both lymphocytes and CD8 + T cells in BW were significantly higher in BPD (median, 6.6%, and 78.0%) when compared with asthma (3.4% and 67.8%, p = 0.002 and p = 0.040) and healthy (3.8% and 40%, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). In all adults born prematurely (preterm and BPD), lymphocyte proportion correlated negatively with forced vital capacity (r= -0.324, p = 0.036) and CD8 + T cells correlated with forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV

The characteristics of patients with severe asthma in the Chinese population remain unclear.
A retrospective review was conducted in patients with severe asthma. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Patients were grouped according to phenotypes in terms of exacerbations, body mass index (BMI) and fixed airway obstruction (FAO) status, and the characteristics of different groups were compared. Comorbidities, factors that influence asthma phenotypes, were also analyzed in the study.
A total of 228 patients with severe asthma were included in our study. They were more likely to be overweight or obese. A total of 41.7% of the patients received GINA step 5 therapy, and 43.4% had a history of receiving regular or intermittent oral corticosteroids (OCS). Severe asthmatic patients with comorbidities were prone to have more asthma symptoms and decreased quality of life than patients without comorbidities. Patients with exacerbations were characterized by longer duration of asthma, poorer lung function, and worse asthma control. Overweight or obese patients tended to have more asthma symptoms, poorer lung function and more asthma-related comorbidities. Compared to patients without FAO, those in the FAO group were older, with longer duration of asthma and more exacerbations.
The existence of comorbidities in patients with severe asthma could result in more asthma symptoms and decreased quality of life. Patients with exacerbations or with overweight or obese phenotypes were characterized by poorer lung function and worse asthma control.

This study aimed to determine the extent to which medical and lifestyle preconception health risk factors are documented in general practice EMRs.
We conducted an audit of the documentation of medical and lifestyle preconception risk factors in 10 general practice EMRs in Melbourne, Australia. We retrospectively analysed the EMRs of 100 consecutive women aged 18-44 years who visited each practice between January and September 2022. Using a template informed by PCC guidelines, we extracted data from structured fields in the EMR and conducted a descriptive analysis.
Among the data extracted, the more commonly documented medical and lifestyle preconception health risk factors in the EMRs included smoking (79%), blood pressure (74%), alcohol consumption (63%) and body mass index (57%). Among the women audited, 14% were smokers, 24% were obese, 7% had high blood pressure, 5% had diabetes, 28% had a mental health condition, 13% had asthma, 6% had thyroid disease and 17% had been prescribed and could be using a potentially teratogenic medication.

38336314,Identification of rBlo t 41 with a chitin-binding type-2 domain: A novel major allergen from Blomia tropicalis.,2024-02-10,"Blomia tropicalis (B. tropicalis) has been reported to impose an increased risk of allergic diseases. However, few characteristics of the unknown allergen components responsible for B. tropicalis allergy and clinical relevance have been fully identified.
We synthesized and characterized the physicochemical properties and cross-reactivity of the newly discovered recombinant B. tropicalis group 41 allergen (rBlo t 41). Subsequently, sera were collected from 107 B. tropicalis allergic subjects to evaluate the prevalence of the rBlo t 41. Lastly, its allergenicity was tested in humans by basophil activation assays, and in mice by a model of allergic asthma.
The mature protein of rBlo t 41 was described as 104 amino acids long and 15.8 kDa, and its limited cross-reactivity was observed between allergens of house dust mites (HDM). Sensitization rate of rBlo t 41 (56.07 %) was lower than rBlo t 2 (76.29 %) and rBlo t 5 (69.07 %) in our study. Besides, rBlo t 41 elicited CD63 upregulation in basophils, whereas rBlo t 41-sensitized mice generated rBlo t 41-IgE and developed allergic airway inflammation after allergen exposure. Of note, component-based tests showed a high area under curve value (AUC = 0.75) of rBlo t 41, displaying its favorable diagnostic potential in B. tropicalis allergy.
rBlo t 41 was identified as a candidate novel major allergen with good diagnostic potential in B. tropicalis sensitization. Additionally, we provided strong evidence about rBlo t 41 on the clinically relevant manifestations in B. tropicalis allergies, conducive to facilitating the development of component-resolved diagnosis.",,"[{'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Wenting', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Jiale', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Xianhui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Aoli', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xv', 'firstname': 'Miaoyuan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Dongmei', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Clinical Research Center, The Affiliated Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Cunyin', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Clinical Research Center, The Affiliated Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Cui', 'firstname': 'Yubao', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Clinical Research Center, The Affiliated Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China.

38335422,Association of serum YKL-40 and DPP4 with T2-high asthma in Chinese adults.,2024-02-09,"This study aimed to assess the utility of serum YKL-40 and serum dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) as biomarkers for distinguishing between type 2 (T2)-high and T2-low asthma in the Chinese population. Additionally, we sought to explore the associations of serum YKL-40 and DPP4 levels with asthma characteristics and conventional markers. A real-world observational cross-sectional study was conducted, involving a total of 75 adult asthma patients. We collected general information, including demographics and medical history. Measurements included complete blood count, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), post-bronchodilator spirometry, serum YKL-40 and serum DPP4 levels. Asthma endotypes, T2-high and T2-low, were defined through a comprehensive review of existing literature and expert group discussions. Logistic and linear regression models were employed. Our findings indicated no significant association between serum YKL-40 or serum DPP4 levels and T2-high asthma across all models. In the fully adjusted model, their odds ratios (OR) were 0.967 (95% CI: 0.920-1.017) and 0.997 (95% CI: 0.993-1.001), respectively. Notably, serum YKL-40 exhibited a positive correlation with FeNO (β = 0.382, 95% CI: 0.230-0.533) after adjusting for confounding factors. This association, however, diminished in patients under 40 years old (P = .24), males (P = .25), and those with FEV1%pred of 80% or higher (P = .25). Serum DPP4 demonstrated a negative correlation with FEV1/FVC in the fully adjusted model (β: -0.005, 95% CI: -0.009, -0.000). Among Chinese adult asthma patients, a positive correlation was observed between serum YKL-40 levels and FeNO in females aged over 40 with FEV1%pred less than 80%. Additionally, a weak negative correlation was found between serum DPP4 levels and FEV1/FVC. However, neither serum YKL-40 nor serum DPP4 levels exhibited the capability to differentiate between T2-high and T2-low asthma.",,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Liang', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Mei', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Qian-Yun', 'initials': 'QY', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Ji-Hong', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Mei', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Qin', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Feng', 'initials': 'XF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing City, Chongqing, China.""}]"
38335270,Progressive accumulation of hyperinflammatory NKG2D,2024-02-09,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that often precedes the development of food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. The prevailing paradigm holds that a reduced frequency and function of natural killer (NK) cell contributes to AD pathogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms and contributions of NK cells to allergic comorbidities remain ill-defined. Here, analysis of circulating NK cells in a longitudinal early life cohort of children with AD revealed a progressive accumulation of NK cells with low expression of the activating receptor NKG2D, which was linked to more severe AD and sensitivity to allergens. This was most notable in children co-sensitized to food and aeroallergens, a risk factor for development of asthma. Individual-level longitudinal analysis in a subset of children revealed coincident reduction of NKG2D on NK cells with acquired or persistent sensitization, and this was associated with impaired skin barrier function assessed by transepidermal water loss. Low expression of NKG2D on NK cells was paradoxically associated with depressed cytolytic function but exaggerated release of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. These observations provide important insights into a potential mechanism underlying the development of allergic comorbidity in early life in children with AD, which involves altered NK cell functional responses, and define an endotype of severe AD.",,"[{'lastname': 'Ochayon', 'firstname': 'David E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDivision of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'DeVore', 'firstname': 'Stanley B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': ""Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nMedical Scientist Training Program, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nCancer and Cell Biology Program, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Wan-Chi', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': ""Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Krishnamurthy', 'firstname': 'Durga', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDivision of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Seelamneni', 'firstname': 'Harsha', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDivision of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Grashel', 'firstname': 'Brittany', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': ""Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Spagna', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Andorf', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDivision of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDivision of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Lisa J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': ""Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDivision of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Biagini', 'firstname': 'Jocelyn M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': ""Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Waggoner', 'firstname': 'Stephen N', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nMedical Scientist Training Program, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDivision of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Khurana Hershey', 'firstname': 'Gurjit K', 'initials': 'GK', 'affiliation': ""Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nMedical Scientist Training Program, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nCancer and Cell Biology Program, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""}]"
38335209,"COVID-19 in patients presenting with malaria-like symptoms at a primary healthcare facility in Accra, Ghana.",2024-02-09,"Malaria is a common and severe public health problem in Ghana and largely responsible for febrile symptoms presented at health facilities in the country. Other infectious diseases, including COVID-19, may mimic malaria due to their shared non-specific symptoms such as fever and headache thus leading to misdiagnosis. This study therefore investigated COVID-19 among patients presenting with malaria-like symptoms at Korle-Bu Polyclinic, Accra, Ghana.
This study enrolled 300 patients presenting with malaria-like symptoms aged ≥18yrs. After consent was obtained from study patients, two to three millilitres of whole blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples, were collected for screening of Plasmodium falciparum using malaria rapid diagnostic test, microscopy and nested PCR, and SARS-CoV-2 using SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and Real-time PCR, respectively. The plasma and whole blood were also used for COVID-19 antibody testing and full blood counts using hematological analyser. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing was performed using MinIon sequencing.
The prevalence of malaria by microscopy, RDT and nested PCR were 2.3%, 2.3% and 2.7% respectively. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test and Real-time PCR were 8.7% and 20% respectively. The Delta variant was reported in 23 of 25 SARS-CoV-2 positives with CT values below 30. Headache was the most common symptom presented by study participants (95%). Comorbidities reported were hypertension, asthma and diabetes. One hundred and thirteen (37.8%) of the study participants had prior exposure to SARS CoV-2 and (34/51) 66.7% of Astrazeneca vaccinated patients had no IgG antibody.
It may be difficult to use clinical characteristics to distinguish between patients with COVID-19 having malaria-like symptoms. Detection of IgM using RDTs may be useful in predicting CT values for SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR and therefore transmission.",It may be difficult to use clinical characteristics to distinguish between patients with COVID-19 having malaria-like symptoms.

38335181,A targeted amplicon next-generation sequencing assay for tryptase genotyping to support personalized therapy in mast cell-related disorders.,2024-02-09,"Tryptase, the most abundant mast cell granule protein, is elevated in severe asthma patients independent of type 2 inflammation status. Higher active β tryptase allele counts are associated with higher levels of peripheral tryptase and lower clinical benefit from anti-IgE therapies. Tryptase is a therapeutic target of interest in severe asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria. Active and inactive allele counts may enable stratification to assess response to therapies in asthmatic patient subpopulations. Tryptase gene loci TPSAB1 and TPSB2 have high levels of sequence identity, which makes genotyping a challenging task. Here, we report a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay and downstream bioinformatics analysis for determining polymorphisms at tryptase TPSAB1 and TPSB2 loci. Machine learning modeling using multiple polymorphisms in the tryptase loci was used to improve the accuracy of genotyping calls. The assay was tested and qualified on DNA extracted from whole blood of healthy donors and asthma patients, achieving accuracy of 96%, 96% and 94% for estimation of inactive α and βΙΙΙFS tryptase alleles and α duplication on TPSAB1, respectively. The reported NGS assay is a cost-effective method that is more efficient than Sanger sequencing and provides coverage to evaluate known as well as unreported tryptase polymorphisms.",,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Hackney', 'firstname': 'Jason A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Choy', 'firstname': 'David F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nersesian', 'firstname': 'Rhea', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Staton', 'firstname': 'Tracy L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Fang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Toghi Eshghi', 'firstname': 'Shadi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Genentech Research and Early Development, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.'}]"

38334904,Development of a Patient Journey Map for Improving Patient Experience and Quality of Atopic Dermatitis Care.,2024-02-09,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects both children and adults. AD increases the risk of developing comorbidities like asthma, allergic rhinitis and food allergies. AD patients face difficulties, including itching, lack of effective treatments, lack of funding and discomfort in seeking a diagnosis or treatment. This study aims to identify the main barriers and opportunities to improve the experience of patients with AD and provide high-quality care.
Patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals were recruited from the Dermatology Department at Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda University Hospital (Madrid, Spain). Interviews with patients, caregivers and professionals were performed. Participants used storyboards to depict their preferred scenarios for improving healthcare interactions and create a Patient Journey Map.
A total of 15 participants were included in the study. Early symptoms of AD were commonly described as undefined stages. As symptoms worsened, patients and caregivers expressed uncertainty and frustration. Patients became concerned about AD after their first serious flare and started experiencing intense itching, eczema, wounds, shedding or asthma. Topical corticosteroids were used to manage flares, but their effectiveness diminished over time, causing further frustration. Because of the ineffectiveness of their initial treatments, dermatologists observed that patients tended to downplay symptoms and how they affected their quality of life. The specialized treatment of severe AD significantly changed patients' emotional states. Despite AD's chronic nature, patients strived to enjoy remission periods and cope with flares. Psychological and emotional support was crucial for patients and caregivers, a need addressed by the Patients' School initiative at HUPHM hospital.
The severity of AD has a profound impact on patients' lives. Patient and caregiver emotional and social needs can be met by adequate communication, access to effective treatments and comprehensive psychological support.","The severity of AD has a profound impact on patients' lives.

We compared adolescents, young adults and adults on symptoms, control levels, and medication adherence.
In a cross-sectional study (2015-2022), we assessed European users of the MASK-air mHealth app of three age groups: adolescents (13-18 years), young adults (18-26 years), and adults (>26 years). We compared them on their reported rhinitis and asthma symptoms, use and adherence to rhinitis and asthma treatment and app adherence. Allergy symptoms and control were assessed by means of visual analogue scales (VASs) on rhinitis or asthma, the combined symptom-medication score (CSMS), and the electronic daily control score for asthma (e-DASTHMA). We built multivariable regression models to compare symptoms or medication accounting for potential differences in demographic characteristics and baseline severity.
We assessed 965 adolescent users (15,252 days), 4595 young adults (58,161 days), and 15,154 adult users (258,796 days). Users of all three age groups displayed similar app adherence. In multivariable models, age groups were not found to significantly differ in their adherence to rhinitis or asthma medication. These models also found that adolescents reported lower VAS on global allergy, ocular, and asthma symptoms (as well as lower CSMS) than young adults and adults.
Adolescents reported a better rhinitis and asthma control than young adults and adults, even though similar medication adherence levels were observed across age groups.

38334146,Identification of allergens from Aspergillus fumigatus-Potential association with lung damage in asthma.,2024-02-09,"Component-resolved diagnosis allows detection of IgE sensitization having the advantage of reproducibility and standardization compared to crude extracts. The main disadvantage of the traditional allergen identification methods, 1- or 2-dimensional western blotting and screening of expression cDNA libraries with patients' IgEs, is that the native structure of the protein is not necessarily maintained.
We used a novel immunoprecipitation technique in combination with mass spectrometry to identify new allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus. Magnetic Dynabeads coupled with anti-human IgE antibodies were used to purify human serum IgE and subsequently allergens from A. fumigatus protein extract.
Of the 184 proteins detected by subsequent mass peptide fingerprinting, a subset of 13 were recombinantly expressed and purified. In a panel of 52 A. fumigatus-sensitized people with asthma, 23 non-fungal-sensitized asthmatics and 18 healthy individuals, only the former showed an IgE reaction by immunoblotting and/or ELISA. We discovered 11 proteins not yet described as A. fumigatus allergens, with fructose-bisphosphate aldolase class II (FBA2) (33%), NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (31%) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (27%) being the most prevalent. With respect to these three allergens, native versus denatured protein assays indicated a better recognition of the native proteins. Seven of 11 allergens fulfilled the WHO/IUIS criteria and were accepted as new A. fumigatus allergens.
In conclusion, we introduce a straightforward method of allergen identification from complex allergenic sources such as A. fumigatus by immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry, which has the advantage over traditional methods of identifying allergens by maintaining the structure of the proteins.","In conclusion, we introduce a straightforward method of allergen identification from complex allergenic sources such as A. fumigatus by immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry, which has the advantage over traditional methods of identifying allergens by maintaining the structure of the proteins.","[{'lastname': 'Rick', 'firstname': 'Eva-Maria', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Sciences, Aerobiology and Mycology Group, Institute for Lung Health, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Woolnough', 'firstname': 'Kerry', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Richardson', 'firstname': 'Matthew', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Monteiro', 'firstname': 'William', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Craner', 'firstname': 'Michelle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bourne', 'firstname': 'Michelle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Cousins', 'firstname': 'David John', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Sciences, Aerobiology and Mycology Group, Institute for Lung Health, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Swoboda', 'firstname': 'Ines', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Competence Center for Molecular Biotechnology, Molecular Biotechnology Section, FH Campus Wien, University of Applied Sciences, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Wardlaw', 'firstname': 'Andrew John', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Sciences, Aerobiology and Mycology Group, Institute for Lung Health, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.\nDepartment of Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Pashley', 'firstname': 'Catherine Helen', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Sciences, Aerobiology and Mycology Group, Institute for Lung Health, Leicester Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}]"

38333835,Research trends on airway remodeling: A bibliometrics analysis.,2024-02-09,"Airway remodeling is an essential pathological basis of respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD, which is significantly related to pulmonary function and clinical symptoms. And pulmonary disease can be improved by regulating airway remodeling. This study aimed to establish a knowledge map of airway remodeling to clarify current research hotspots and future research trends.
A comprehensive search was performed to analyze all relevant articles on airway remodeling using the Web of Science Core Collection Database from January 01, 2004 to June 03, 2023.2 reviewers screened the retrieved literature. Besides, the CiteSpace (6.2. R3) and VOSviewer (1.6.19) were utilized to visualize the research focus and trend regarding the effect of airway remodeling.
A total of 4077 articles about airway remodeling were retrieved. The United States is the country with the most published literature, underscoring the country's role in airway remodeling. In recent years, China has been the country with the fastest growth in the number of published literature, suggesting that China will play a more critical role in airway remodeling in the future. From the perspective of co-operation among countries, European co-operation was closer than Asian co-operation. The co-citation analysis showed that 98,313 citations were recorded in 3594 articles, and 25 clusters could be realized. In recent years, Burst detection shows that oxidative stress and epithelial-mesenchymal transition are hot words.
Based on the bibliometric analysis of airway remodeling studies in the past 20 years, a multi-level knowledge structure map was drawn, it mainly includes countries, institutions, research fields, authors, journals, keywords and so on. The research directions represented by obstructive airway disease, PDGF-BB treatment of airway smooth muscle, allergen-induced airway remodeling, extracellular matrix, and non-coding RNA are the research hotspots in the field of airway remodeling.

In Austria, there is a lack of real-world data on treatment adjustments of COPD outpatients and their underlying rationale. The STEP study characterised change patterns of pharmacological maintenance therapy in COPD outpatients in predefined categories of step-up, step-down and switch, the underlying reasons, and predictors in clinical routine in Austria.
STEP was a single-visit non-interventional study in Austria. 77 pulmonologists based in outpatient clinics documented previous and adapted COPD therapy, reason for change, patient characteristics, COPD phenotype, and lung function. Patients' COPD symptom burden was assessed by using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Predictors for therapy changes were identified.
1137 patients were studied (mean±sd age 67±10 years; 56.9% male; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s 56.3% predicted; Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease B and E stages 66% and 19%, respectively; mean CAT score 17.5). Therapy step-up was observed in 59.3%, treatment switch in 21.7% and step-down in 19.0% of patients. Triple therapy comprised the biggest proportion of inhalation treatment (53.3%). Physicians reported lung function, symptom burden and exacerbations as the main reasons for step-up or step-down, whereas switches within the same treatment class were predominantly caused by device issues. Predictors for step-up were comorbid asthma and exacerbations among others.
STEP was the first study to investigate COPD therapy changes in clinical routine in Austria. The most frequent treatment adjustment was step-up, followed by treatment switch and step-down.

38332964,Determining Adherence to Inhaled Corticosteroids From the Epic Electronic Medical Record.,2024-02-09,"Often we call the patient's pharmacy to obtain a refill history to assess inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) adherence. The purpose of this project was to determine the accuracy of refill histories for ICS (with or without long-acting beta agonist) listed in Epic's Medication Dispense History.
We evaluated 61 patients and used data from 38 who met the following criteria: 1) under the care of the UF Pediatric Severe Asthma Clinic; 2) taking the same dose of the same ICS product for 6 months before the patient's last clinic visit; and 3) having data available from the pharmacy where the last ICS prescription was electronically sent. We called the pharmacies to obtain a verbal report of their refill record. Then, we compared the number of refills reported to the number listed in Epic's records using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test.
Of the 293 refill dates listed in Epic, 157 were duplicates, giving a 54% error. After deleting duplicates, the mean (SD) number of refills listed in Epic was 3.6 (2.0) compared with 3.3 (2.0) in pharmacies over a period of 6 months (p < 0.0001). After removing duplicates Epic correctly reported the total number of refills for 30 of the 38 patients (78.9%). Seven of the remaining patients had more refills listed in Epic while 1 patient had more refills dispensed.
This study indicates that our version of Epic over-reports refills thus limiting assessment of adherence. In contrast, absence of refills in Epic is a clear indication of poor adherence.","This study indicates that our version of Epic over-reports refills thus limiting assessment of adherence.

38332896,The bradykinin-forming cascade in anaphylaxis and ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema/airway obstruction.,2024-02-09,"Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening multi-system allergic reaction to a biological trigger resulting in the release of potent inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils and causing symptoms in at least two organ systems that generally include skin, lungs, heart, or gastrointestinal tract in any combination. One exception is profound hypotension as an isolated symptom. There are two types of triggers of anaphylaxis: immunologic and non-Immunologic. Immunologic anaphylaxis is initiated when a foreign antigen directly binds to IgE expressed on mast cells or basophils and induces the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances resulting in vasodilation, vascular leakage, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and heart muscle depression. If left untreated, death by shock (profound hypotension) or asphyxiation (airway obstruction) can occur. The non-immunologic pathway, on the other hand, can be initiated in many ways. A foreign substance can directly bind to receptors of mast cells and basophils leading to degranulation. There can be immune complex activation of the classical complement cascade with the release of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a with subsequent recruitment of mast cells and basophils. Finally, hyperosmolar contrast agents can cause blood cell lysis, enzyme release, and complement activation, resulting in anaphylactoid (anaphylactic-like) symptoms. In this report we emphasize the recruitment of the bradykinin-forming cascade in mast cell dependent anaphylactic reactions as a potential mediator of severe hypotension, or airway compromise (asthma, laryngeal edema). We also consider airway obstruction due to inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with a diminished rate of endogenous bradykinin metabolism, leading not only to laryngeal edema, but massive tongue swelling with aspiration of secretions.",,"[{'lastname': 'Ghebrehiwet', 'firstname': 'Berhane', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Clinical Immunology, SUNY-Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Joseph', 'firstname': 'Kusumam', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Clinical Immunology, SUNY-Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, United States.\nDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaplan', 'firstname': 'Allen P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States.'}]"

This was a phase 2/3, open-label trial in children aged 28 days to 17 years hospitalized for polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants received for ≤10 days once-daily intravenous remdesivir doses defined using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (for ≥40 kg, 200 mg day 1, then 100 mg/day; for age ≥28 days and ≥3 to <40 kg, 5 mg/kg day 1, then 2.5 mg/kg/day). Sparse pharmacokinetic samples were analyzed using population-pharmacokinetic approaches for remdesivir and metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524.
Among 53 participants, at enrollment the median (Q1, Q3) number of days of COVID-19 symptoms was 5 (3, 7) and hospitalization was 1 (1, 3). Underlying conditions included obesity in 19 (37%), asthma in 11 (21%), and cardiac disorders in 11 (21%). Median duration of remdesivir treatment was 5 days (range, 1-10). Remdesivir treatment had no new apparent safety trends. Two participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events including elevated transaminases; both had elevated transaminases at baseline. Three deaths occurred during treatment (and 1 after).

38332723,Gene therapy with AAV9-SGPL1 in an animal model of lung fibrosis.,2024-02-09,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring disease of the lung that leads rapidly to respiratory failure. Novel approaches to treatment are urgently needed. The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is increased in IPF lungs and promotes proinflammatory and profibrotic TGF-β signaling. Hence, decreasing lung S1P represents a potential therapeutic strategy for IPF. S1P is degraded by the intracellular enzyme S1P lyase (SPL). Here we find that a knock-in mouse with a missense SPL mutation mimicking human disease resulted in reduced SPL activity, increased S1P, increased TGF-β signaling, increased lung fibrosis, and higher mortality after injury compared to wild type (WT). We then tested adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of human SGPL1 (AAV-SPL) in mice as a therapeutic modality. Intravenous treatment with AAV-SPL augmented lung SPL activity, attenuated S1P levels within the lungs, and decreased injury-induced fibrosis compared to controls treated with saline or only AAV. We confirmed that AAV-SPL treatment led to higher expression of SPL in the epithelial and fibroblast compartments during bleomycin-induced lung injury.

38332696,The role of NLRP3 inflammasome in type 2 inflammation related diseases.,2024-02-09,"Type 2 inflammation related diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, are diverse and affect multiple systems in the human body. It is common for individuals to have multiple co-existing type 2 inflammation related diseases, which can impose a significant financial and living burden on patients. However, the exact pathogenesis of these diseases is still unclear. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a protein complex composed of the NLRP3 protein, ASC, and Caspase-1, and is activated through various mechanisms, including the NF-κB pathway, ion channels, and lysosomal damage. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the immune response to pathogens and cellular damage. Recent studies have indicated a strong correlation between the abnormal activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the onset of type 2 inflammation. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that suppressing NLRP3 expression effectively diminishes the inflammatory response, highlighting its promising therapeutic applications. Therefore, this article reviews the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the development and therapy of multiple type 2 inflammation related diseases.",,"[{'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Shenming', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.\nMedical Ozone Research Center of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.\nMedical Ozone Research Center of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Lina', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.\nMedical Ozone Research Center of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Jianyun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.\nMedical Ozone Research Center of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""}]"

People with asthma are more vulnerable to the health impact of LFS than general populations. The aim of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of personal strategies to reduce the effect of LFS on asthma-related outcomes.
We will electronically search databases such as Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Clinical Trials Register to identify eligible articles for the review. Screening of search results and data extraction from included studies will be completed by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias (RoB 2) will be assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomised Studies for observational studies, the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the RoB 2 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool for non-RCTs. A random-effect meta-analysis will be performed to determine the pooled summary of findings of the included studies. If meta-analysis is not possible, we will conduct a narrative synthesis. Findings will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
This study will synthesise the available evidence obtained from published studies and as such, no ethical approval is required. The review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

38331806,Prevalence of asthma in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a scoping review.,2024-02-09,"According to the Th1/Th2 paradigm, the expansion of Th1-type clones in individuals with type 1 diabetes results in reduced Th2-type clones, preventing the development of atopic diseases and vice versa. However, there is no consensus regarding the direct or inverse relationship between autoimmune and atopic diseases.
The aim of this scoping review was to examine the knowledge gap about the possibility of coexistence of asthma and type 1 diabetes and determine the prevalence of this association.
A scoping review was conducted, following the proposal of the Joanna Briggs Institute. The Population, Concept, and Context strategy was used to formulate the guiding question. The proposed question was: ""What is the prevalence of asthma in people with T1DM?"" After excluding duplicate articles, analyzing titles and abstracts, and excluding articles that did not answer the guiding question, 17 articles remained and were included in this review.
Most of the articles selected conformed to the Th1/Th2 hypothesis, as the prevalence of asthma was lower in individuals with T1DM. However, similar or higher prevalence of asthma was found between cases and controls in few articles.
The prevalence of asthma in people with T1DM ranged from 1.7% to 23.1%. Maybe the mechanisms that characterizes the Th1/Th2 paradigm aren't as simple as just the interaction of certain cytokines, since Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases and Th2- mediated atopy can coexist.","The prevalence of asthma in people with T1DM ranged from 1.7% to 23.1%.

38331782,The airway neuro-immune axis as a therapeutic target in allergic airway diseases.,2024-02-09,"Recent evidence has increasingly underscored the importance of the neuro-immune axis in mediating allergic airway diseases, such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. The intimate spatial relationship between neurons and immune cells suggests that their interactions play a pivotal role in regulating allergic airway inflammation. Upon direct activation by allergens, neurons and immune cells engage in interactions, during which neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released by neurons modulate immune cell activity. Meanwhile, immune cells release inflammatory mediators such as histamine and cytokines, stimulating neurons and amplifying neuropeptide production, thereby exacerbating allergic inflammation. The dynamic interplay between the nervous and immune systems suggests that targeting the neuro-immune axis in the airway could represent a novel approach to treating allergic airway diseases. This review summarized recent evidence on the nervous system's regulatory mechanisms in immune responses and identified potential therapeutic targets along the peripheral nerve-immune axis for allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis.

38331769,Monoclonal antibodies in idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a scoping review.,2024-02-09,"Idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (ICEP) is a rare disease characterized by pulmonary radiological alterations, peripheral eosinophilia, and demonstrated pulmonary eosinophilia. Oral steroids (OSs) are the standard management, but relapses occur in up to 50% of patients during the decrease or suspension of steroids, usually requiring reinitiation of treatment, exposing patients to secondary events derived from the management. Management with monoclonal antibodies has been proposed in these cases to control the disease and limit the secondary effects. The objective is to describe the extent and type of evidence regarding the use of monoclonal antibodies for ICEP.
A panoramic review of the literature was performed. Observational and experimental studies of pediatric and adult populations that managed recurrent ICEP with monoclonal antibodies were included. Data search, selection, and extraction were performed by two independent reviewers.
937 studies were found. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 37 titles remained for the final analysis: a retrospective, observational, real-life study, two case series publications, and 34 case reports published in academic poster sessions and letters to the editor. In general, the use of monoclonal antibodies approved for severe asthma could be useful for the control of ICEP, since most of the results show a good response for clinical and radiological outcomes. Biological drugs seem to be a safer option for controlling relapses in ICEP, allowing lowering/suspension of OSs, and sometimes replacing them in patients intolerant to them, patients with significant comorbidities, and patients who have already developed adverse events.
The extent of the evidence supporting management of ICEP with monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 and IgE (omalizumab) is limited, but it could be promising in patients who present frequent relapses, in cortico-dependent individuals, or in patients in whom the use of steroids is contraindicated. The extent of the evidence for management with dupilumab is more limited. Studies with better design and structure are needed to evaluate quality of life and outcomes during a clear follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review of the literature showing the extent of the evidence for the management of ICEP with monoclonal antibodies.","The extent of the evidence supporting management of ICEP with monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 and IgE (omalizumab) is limited, but it could be promising in patients who present frequent relapses, in cortico-dependent individuals, or in patients in whom the use of steroids is contraindicated.

A Scoping Review of the Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids on the Voice Quality of Asthmatic Children.",2024-02-09,"Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are a common treatment for certain lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder in adults, and asthma across the lifespan. There is a link between the use of ICS and dysphonia in adults. This scoping review aims to investigate the incidence of dysphonia, in children aged under 12, who use ICS to treat asthma.
A scoping review was conducted, in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005). ASHAWire, Science Direct, PubMed, and ProQuest databases were searched. Out of the total yield of 1471 articles, four articles met the inclusion criteria, that is, were primary studies reporting on voice quality in children who use ICS, who present with asthma and/or allergy.
The majority of papers yielded from the initial search were retrieved because of the use of the term ""dysphonia"" in the basic definitions of asthma and descriptors of its side effects. Only four studies presented primary data about the presence of dysphonia in asthmatic children (with or without comorbid allergic conditions). None specifically investigated the relationship between ICS and dysphonia. Research questions focused on side effects associated with allergies and asthma, which included some information about medication. Only three of the four studies conducted a comprehensive review of the voice and utilized video laryngoscopy.
The evidence of a relationship, between ICS and dysphonia in children, is not conclusive, and is complicated by the connection between asthma, and breath support for phonation.

Population estimates of celiac disease (CeD) risk in those with PAD are limited.
To estimate population risk of PAD in individuals with CeD.
We conducted a nationwide case-control study in Swedish individuals who received a diagnosis of CeD between 1997 and 2017 (n = 34,980), matched to population comparators by age, sex, calendar year, and county. The CeD was confirmed through the Epidemiology Strengthened by histopathology Reports in Sweden study, which provided information on biopsy specimens from each of Sweden's pathology departments. PAD was identified using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision coding and categorized according to the International Union of Immunologic Societies. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs.
PAD was more prevalent in CeD than in population controls (n = 105 [0.3%] vs n = 57 [0.033%], respectively). This translated to an aOR of 8.23 (95% CI 5.95-11.48). The association was strongest with common variable immunodeficiency (aOR 17.25; 95% CI 6.86-52.40), and slightly lower in other PAD (aOR 8.39; 95% CI 5.79-12.32). The risk of CeD remained increased at least 5 years after diagnosis of PAD (aOR 4.79; 95% CI 2.89-7.97, P-heterogeneity ≤ 0.001).
PAD was associated with an increased risk of CeD. A particularly strong association was seen in those with CVID, although this should be interpreted cautiously given the limited understanding of the mechanisms of histopathologic changes in these patients.","PAD was associated with an increased risk of CeD.

38330996,[Advances in the management of asthma].,2024-02-09,"Asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory airway disease that causes relevant morbidity across individuals of all age cohorts. In recent years, advances in the understanding of asthma pathophysiology have led to the development of treatments tailored to specific pheno- and endotypes of the disease. This has significantly changed asthma management, especially for patients with severe disease. These new treatment options offer individuals with asthma access to personalized and disease-modifying therapies. The present paper is a comprehensive overview of recent clinical studies and of German and international guideline updates on asthma management.
GRUNDZüGE DER THERAPIE : Eine bedarfsweise Monotherapie mit kurzwirksamen Beta-2-Sympathomimetika (SABA) stellt nicht mehr die bevorzugte Therapie in der Stufe 1 dar. Sie ist mit einem Verlust an Asthma-Kontrolle und einem Anstieg der asthmabezogenen Mortalität assoziiert. Die bedarfsweise Anwendung einer Fixkombination aus einem inhalativen Kortikosteroid mit einem Beta-2-Sympathomimetikum (ICS-Formoterol) zeigte eine höhere Effektivität und Sicherheit gegenüber der SABA-Monotherapie. Insgesamt wird der Stellenwert antiinflammatorischer Therapien in den aktualisierten Leitlinien gestärkt.
Tezepelumab wurde als mittlerweile 6. Biologikum zur Therapie von Patient*innen mit schwerem Asthma zugelassen. Tezepelumab richtet sich gegen das Zytokin TSLP, welches eine Rolle in der initialen Entzündungsreaktion bei Asthma spielt. Eine Verordnung ist unabhängig von erhöhten Biomarkern als „Add-on“ zur Basistherapie möglich.
Akute Atemwegserkrankungen, meist viraler Genese, gelten als der Hauptauslöser für Asthma-Exazerbationen. Die zu Beginn der Erkältungssaison 2022/23 vom RKI gemeldeten Fallzahlen an Influenza- sowie RSV-Infektionen waren im Vergleich zu den Pandemiejahren zuvor deutlich erhöht. Im weiteren Verlauf hat sich die Aktivität akuter Atemwegserkrankungen auf einem hohen Niveau stabilisiert. Ein vermehrtes Auftreten von Asthma-Exazerbationen lässt sich daher auch für Deutschland vermuten.
Verbesserte Therapiekonzepte führen zu einem neuen Therapieziel. Die Ziele einer Asthma-Therapie sind nicht die Symptombehandlung, sondern die langfristige Prävention von asthmabezogenen Symptomen, der Erhalt der Lungenfunktion und der fehlende Bedarf an systemischen Kortikosteroiden im Sinne einer Remission der Erkrankung.",,"[{'lastname': 'Westhölter', 'firstname': 'Dirk', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Pneumologie, Universitätsmedizin Essen - Ruhrlandklinik, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reuter', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Pneumologie, Universitätsmedizin Essen - Ruhrlandklinik, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Taube', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Pneumologie, Universitätsmedizin Essen - Ruhrlandklinik, Essen, Germany.'}]"

38329636,Three Main SCFAs Mitigate Lung Inflammation and Tissue Remodeling Nlrp3-Dependent in Murine HDM-Induced Neutrophilic Asthma.,2024-02-08,"Neutrophilic asthma is generally defined by poorly controlled symptoms and high levels of neutrophils in the lungs. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are proposed as nonpharmacological therapy for allergic asthma, but their impact on the neutrophilic asthma lacks evidence. SCFAs regulate immune cell responses and impact the inflammasome NLRP3, a potential pharmacological target for neutrophilic asthma. Here, we explored the capacity of SCFAs to mitigate murine-induced neutrophilic asthma and the contribution of NLRP3 to this asthma. The objective of this study is to analyze whether SCFAs can attenuate lung inflammation and tissue remodeling in murine neutrophilic asthma and NLRP3 contribution to this endotype. Wild-type (WT) C57BL6 mice orotracheally received 10 μg of HDM (house dust mite) in 80 μL of saline on days 0, 6-10. To explore SCFAs, each HDM group received 200 mM acetate, propionate, or butyrate. To explore NLRP3, Nlrp3 KO mice received the same protocol of HDM. On the 14th day, after euthanasia, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs were collected to evaluate cellularity, inflammatory cytokines, and tissue remodeling. HDM group had increased BALF neutrophil influx, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17A, collagen deposition, and mucus secretion compared to control. SCFAs distinctively attenuate lung inflammation. Only features of tissue remodeling were Nlrp3-dependent such as collagen deposition, mucus secretion, active TGF-β cytokine, and IMs CD206",,"[{'lastname': 'Tagé', 'firstname': 'Barbara S S', 'initials': 'BSS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Science and Technology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), São José dos Campos, SP, 12247-014, Brazil. barbara.tage@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzatti', 'firstname': 'Michelangelo B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, SP, 05468-901, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Vieira', 'firstname': 'Rodolfo P', 'initials': 'RP', 'affiliation': 'Postgraduate Program in Human Movement and Rehabilitation and in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Evangelical University of Goiás (UniEvangélica), Anápolis, GO, 75083-515, Brazil.\nPostgraduate Program in Bioengineering, University Brasil, São Paulo, SP, 08230-030, Brazil.\nPostgraduate Program in Sciences of Human Movement and Rehabilitation, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), Santos, SP, 11010-150, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Keller', 'firstname': 'Alexandre C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, SP, 05468-901, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bortoluci', 'firstname': 'Karina R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, SP, 04023-062, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Aimbire', 'firstname': 'Flávio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Science and Technology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), São José dos Campos, SP, 12247-014, Brazil.'}]"
38329526,Is generative pre-trained transformer artificial intelligence (Chat-GPT) a reliable tool for guidelines synthesis? A preliminary evaluation for biologic CRSwNP therapy.,2024-02-08,"Biologic therapies for Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) have emerged as an auspicious treatment alternative. However, the ideal patient population, dosage, and treatment duration are yet to be well-defined. Moreover, biologic therapy has disadvantages, such as high costs and limited access. The proposal of a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm offers an intriguing solution for optimizing decision-making protocols.
The AI algorithm was initially programmed to conduct a systematic literature review searching for the current primary guidelines on biologics' clinical efficacy and safety in treating CRSwNP. The review included a total of 12 studies: 6 systematic reviews, 4 expert consensus guidelines, and 2 surveys. Simultaneously, two independent human researchers conducted a literature search to compare the results. Subsequently, the AI was tasked to critically analyze the identified papers, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, thereby creating a decision-making algorithm and pyramid flow chart.
The studies evaluated various biologics, including monoclonal antibodies targeting Interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-4, IL-13, and Immunoglobulin E (IgE), assessing their effectiveness in different patient populations, such as those with comorbid asthma or refractory CRSwNP. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit, demonstrated significant improvement in nasal symptoms and quality of life in patients with CRSwNP in several randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Similarly, mepolizumab and reslizumab, which target IL-5, have also shown efficacy in reducing nasal polyp burden and improving symptoms in patients with CRSwNP, particularly those with comorbid asthma. However, additional studies are required to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of these biologics in treating CRSwNP.
Biologic therapies have surfaced as a promising treatment option for patients with severe or refractory CRSwNP; however, the optimal patient population, dosage, and treatment duration are yet to be defined. The application of AI in decision-making protocols and the creation of therapeutic algorithms for biologic drug selection, could offer fascinating future prospects in the management of CRSwNP.",,"[{'lastname': 'Maniaci', 'firstname': 'Antonino', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, ""Kore"" University of Enna, Enna, Italy. antonino.maniaci@phd.unict.it.\nRhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France. antonino.maniaci@phd.unict.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Saibene', 'firstname': 'Alberto Maria', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nOtolaryngology Unit, Santi Paolo E Carlo Hospital, Department of Health Sciences, Università Degli Studi Di Milano, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Calvo-Henriquez', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nService of Otolaryngology, Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaira', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nMaxillofacial Surgery Unit, University Hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Radulesco', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nENT Surgeon, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, Aix-Marseille Univesity, 147 Bd Baille, 13005, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Michel', 'firstname': 'Justin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'ENT Surgeon, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, Aix-Marseille Univesity, 147 Bd Baille, 13005, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Chiesa-Estomba', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nENT-Head and Neck Department, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastián, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sowerby', 'firstname': 'Leigh', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nDepartment of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Schulich School of Medicine, Western University, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Lobo Duro', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nRhinology, Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgery, Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.\nValdecilla Biomedical Research Institute, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mayo-Yanez', 'firstname': 'Miguel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, A Coruña University Hospital Complex, 15006, A Coruña, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Maza-Solano', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Rhynology Study Group of the Young-Otolaryngologists of the International Federations of Otorhino-Laryngological Societies (YO-IFOS), Paris, France.\nServicio de Otorrinolaringología, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla.

38329377,Retrospective Validation of a Computerized Physiologic Equation to Predict Minute Ventilation Needs in Critically Ill Children.,2024-02-08,"Mechanical ventilation (MV) is pervasive among critically ill children. We sought to validate a computerized physiologic equation to predict minute ventilation requirements in children and test its performance against clinician actions in an in silico trial.
Retrospective, electronic medical record linkage, cohort study.
Quaternary PICU.
Patients undergoing invasive MV, serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis within 1-6 hours, and pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade (NMB).
ABG values were filtered to those occurring during periods of NMB. Simultaneous ABG and minute ventilation data were linked to predict serial Paco2 and pH values using previously published physiologic equations. There were 15,121 included ABGs across 500 encounters among 484 patients, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 20 (10-43) ABGs per encounter at a duration of 3.6 (2.1-4.2) hours. The median (IQR) Paco2 prediction error was 0.00 (-3.07 to 3.00) mm Hg. In Bland-Altman analysis, the mean error was -0.10 mm Hg (95% CI, -0.21 to 0.01 mm Hg). A nested, in silico trial of ABGs meeting criteria for weaning (respiratory alkalosis) or escalation (respiratory acidosis), compared the performance of recommended ventilator changes versus clinician decisions. There were 1,499 of 15,121 ABGs (9.9%) among 278 of 644 (43.2%) encounters included in the trial. Calculated predictions were favorable to clinician actions in 1124 of 1499 ABGs (75.0%), equivalent to clinician choices in 26 of 1499 ABGs (1.7%), and worse than clinician decisions in 349 of 1499 ABGs (23.3%). Calculated recommendations were favorable to clinician decisions in sensitivity analyses limiting respiratory rate, analyzing only when clinicians made changes, excluding asthma, and excluding acute respiratory distress syndrome.
A computerized equation to predict minute ventilation requirements outperformed clinicians' ventilator adjustments in 75% of ABGs from critically ill children in this retrospective analysis.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible enzyme responsible for the breakdown of heme, has been considered an appealing target for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Herein, we report that alleviation of allergic airway inflammation by HO-1-mediated suppression of pyroptosis in airway epithelial cells (AECs). Using house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma models of mice, we found increased gasdermin D (GSDMD) in the airway epithelium. In vivo administration of disulfiram, a specific inhibitor of pore formation by GSDMD, decreased thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) release, T helper type 2 immune response, alleviated airway inflammation, and reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). HO-1 induction by hemin administration reversed these phenotypes. In vitro studies revealed that HO-1 restrained GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and cytokine TSLP release in AECs by binding Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) p65 RHD domain and thus controlling NF-κB-dependent pyroptosis.

38329123,Eosinophils restrain humoral alloimmunity after lung transplantation.,2024-02-08,"While the function of many leukocytes in transplant biology has been well defined, the role of eosinophils is controversial and remains poorly explored. Conflicting data exist regarding eosinophils' role in alloimmunity. Due to their prevalence in the lung, and their defined role in other pulmonary pathologies such as asthma, we set out to explore the role of eosinophils in the long-term maintenance of the lung allograft. We noted that depletion of eosinophils results in the generation of donor-specific antibodies. Eosinophil depletion increased memory B cell, plasma cell, and antibody-secreting cell differentiation and resulted in de novo generation of follicular germinal centers. Germinal center formation depended on the expansion of CD4+Foxp3-Bcl6+CXCR5+PD-1+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which increase in number after eosinophil depletion. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that eosinophils prevent Tfh cell generation by acting as the dominant source of IFN-γ in an established lung allograft, thus facilitating Th1 rather than Tfh polarization of naive CD4+ T cells. Our data thus describe what we believe is a unique and previously unknown role for eosinophils in maintaining allograft tolerance and suggest that indiscriminate administration of eosinophil-lytic corticosteroids for treatment of acute cellular rejection may inadvertently promote humoral alloimmunity.",,"[{'lastname': 'Mei', 'firstname': 'Zhongcheng', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Khalil', 'firstname': 'May A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Yizhan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Dongge', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Banerjee', 'firstname': 'Anirban', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Terada', 'firstname': 'Yuriko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yokoyama', 'firstname': 'Yuhei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kratzmeier', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Kelly', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Lushen', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lau', 'firstname': 'Christine L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Courneya', 'firstname': 'Jean-Paul', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Luzina', 'firstname': 'Irina G', 'initials': 'IG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Atamas', 'firstname': 'Sergei P', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gelman', 'firstname': 'Andrew E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kreisel', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jacobsen', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Krupnick', 'firstname': 'Alexander S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}]"
38328804,IR (index of reactivity)-house dust mite sublingual immunotherapy liquid formulation for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized studies.,2024-02-08,"Although randomized controlled trials (RCT) are the reference standard of evidence in allergen immunotherapy (AIT), nonrandomized studies (NRS) are needed to confirm their results in more representative populations, particularly for treatment duration and persistence. However, when discrepancies are observed between RCT and NRS, NRS reliability decreases because these discrepant results are generally attributed to the methodologic flaws of NRS.
We compared the benefit of sublingual AIT (SLIT) for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in NRS versus RCT focusing on a single product/allergen to reduce heterogeneity.
For meta-analysis, house dust mite (HDM) SLIT liquid formulation studies were sourced from computerized (Medline, Web of Science, and LILACS databases, to January 2023) and manual literature searches. Populations, treatments, and outcome data were combined (DerSimonian-Laird method). Noncomparative NRS were compared to RCT' SLIT arm before and after treatment. Efficacy was determined as the standardized mean difference (SMD) in symptom score (SS) and medication score (MS).
Data from 12 NRS (682 patients) and 8 RCT (176 patients) were analyzed. The benefit with index of reactivity (IR)-HDM SLIT liquid formulation was found significant for, first, SS in both NRS (SMD = -1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.64, -0.90) and RCT (SMD = -0.56; 95% CI, -0.90, -0.21), and second, MS with SMD equal to -1.35 (95% CI, -1.77, -0.93) and -0.46 (95% CI, -0.67, -0.25), respectively. Metaregression showed that symptom improvement was correlated with treatment duration with consistent results in NRS and RCT with 12-month SS data: -0.87 (interquartile range, -1.02, -0.77) and -0.75 (interquartile range, -0.93, -0.41), respectively.
This meta-analysis showed comparable clinical benefit of IR-HDM SLIT liquid formulation increasing over time in both NRS and RCT, suggesting that NRS may reliably integrate RCT results and be considered for guidelines.","This meta-analysis showed comparable clinical benefit of IR-HDM SLIT liquid formulation increasing over time in both NRS and RCT, suggesting that NRS may reliably integrate RCT results and be considered for guidelines.","[{'lastname': 'Di Bona', 'firstname': 'Danilo', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Precision and Regenerative Medicine and Jonic Area, Unit of Allergology, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlucci', 'firstname': 'Palma', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Precision and Regenerative Medicine and Jonic Area, Unit of Allergology, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Spataro', 'firstname': 'Federico', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Precision and Regenerative Medicine and Jonic Area, Unit of Allergology, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Paoletti', 'firstname': 'Giovanni', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Personalized Medicine, Asthma and Allergy, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cognet-Sicé', 'firstname': 'Josiane', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Stallergenes Greer, Antony, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Scurati', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Stallergenes Greer, Antony, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Canonica', 'firstname': 'Giorgio Walter', 'initials': 'GW', 'affiliation': 'Personalized Medicine, Asthma and Allergy, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Italy.'}]"

We sought to determine the burden (prevalence, mortality, and activity and work impairment) of severe asthma in 3 countries in East Africa: Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia.
Using the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society case definition of severe asthma, we analyzed for the prevalence of severe asthma (requiring Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] steps 4-5 asthma medications for the previous year to achieve control) and severe refractory asthma (remains uncontrolled despite treatment with GINA steps 4-5 asthma medications) in a cohort of 1086 asthma patients who had been in care for 12 months and had received all GINA-recommended medications. Asthma control was assessed by the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ).
Overall, the prevalence of severe asthma and severe refractory asthma was 25.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1-28.3) and 4.6% (95% CI, 3.5-6.0), respectively. Patients with severe asthma were (nonsevere vs severe vs severe refractory) older (39, 42, 45 years,

We sought to evaluate the effect of HDM SLIT on asthma control, pulmonary function, and airway inflammation and remodeling throughout the 5-year treatment period.
A total of 140 patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis sensitized to HDM were randomized to receive either drugs alone or drugs plus SLIT for 5 years. The 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), spirometry, quantitative computed tomography, and type 2 biomarkers were assessed.
An improvement in the ACQ-5, AQLQ, and RQLQ scores was observed in the SLIT group compared with the control group. HDM SLIT increased lung function and reduced the percentage of airway wall area. The levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), blood eosinophil, serum specific IgE for HDM, and total IgE decreased and were sustained during the 5 years. The change in type 2 biomarkers correlated with change in the AQLQ score.

38328715,Association of childhood asthma with Gasdermin B (GSDMB) and Oromucoid-like 3 (ORMDL3) genes.,2024-02-08,"Genome-length association studies have shown that Gasdermin B (GSDMB) and Orosomucoid-like 3 (ORMDL3) genes located on the long arm of chromosome 17 are associated with asthma. In this study, it was aimed to determine the possible relationship between asthma control test (ACT), exercise provocation test (ECT), and fractional nitric oxide (FENO) levels and GSDMB and ORMDL3 gene expressions.
59 asthmatic and 38 non-asthmatic children were included in the study. We divided the patient group into two subgroups as mild persistent asthma (29 patients) and moderate persistent asthma (30 patients). ORMDL3, GSDMB gene expression levels, ECT, total IgE levels, and eosinophil counts were measured in all cases. In addition, ACT and FeNO levels were measured in children with asthma. Afterward, the relationship of ORMDL3 and GSDMB gene expression coefficient changes with ECT, ACT, and FeNO was examined.
When patients with ACT ≤15 were compared with patients with ACT ≥20, ORMDL3 and GSDMB gene expressions were increased 6.74 and 11.74 times, respectively. Comparing patients with ACT ≥20 and ACT ≤15 in terms of coefficient changes (ΔCq), higher change values were observed for ΔCq ORMDL3 in patients with ACT ≤15 (p=0.015). Similarly, when patients with FENO ≤25 ppb were compared with patients with FENO >25 ppb, ORMDL3 and GSDMB gene expressions were increased by 2.93 and 3.56 times, respectively. When the coefficient changes were compared, no significant difference was found between FENO≤25 and FENO >25 patients. There was a slight negative correlation between ΔCq values and ACT score (p=0.003, r=-0.418 for ORMDL3, and p=0.016, r=-0.345 for GSDMB). In addition, we observed a statistically significant positive correlation between ORMDL3 and GSDMB gene expressions (r=0.80, p<0.001).
We showed that increased ORMDL3 and GSDMB gene expression levels may be associated with ACT scores, FeNO and ECT in asthma. These findings may encourage future studies with larger numbers of subjects that can use gene expression levels in various asthma phenotypes for prognostic prediction.","We showed that increased ORMDL3 and GSDMB gene expression levels may be associated with ACT scores, FeNO and ECT in asthma.

30.5% of the enrolled patients achieved remission after biologic administration. CliR group showed a lower number of baseline asthma exacerbations and better lung function parameters, with a trend for higher ACT scores and a less frequent history of a positive skin prick test. CliR achievement was unlikely in presence of a higher BMI, a positive skin prick test, an increased number of asthma exacerbations before biologic treatment, anti-muscarinic administration, and a previous diagnosis of EGPA, bronchiectasis or osteoporosis. In contrast, a better lung function, an increased blood eosinophilic count, the presence of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and a more frequent use of reliever therapy predicts remission development. Changes in exacerbations number, OCS use, ACT scores and FEV

38327138,Adverse neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with asthma: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,2024-02-08,"A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 reported increased risks of congenital malformations, neonatal death and neonatal hospitalization amongst infants born to women with asthma compared to infants born to mothers without asthma.
Our objective was to update the evidence on the associations between maternal asthma and adverse neonatal outcomes.
We performed an English-language MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and COCHRANE search with the terms (asthma or wheeze) and (pregnan* or perinat* or obstet*).
Studies published from March 2012 until September 2023 reporting at least one outcome of interest (congenital malformations, stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal mortality, neonatal hospitalization, transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal sepsis) in a population of women with and without asthma.
The study was reported following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Quality of individual studies was assessed by two reviewers independently using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random effects models (≥3 studies) or fixed effect models (≤2 studies) were used with restricted maximum likelihood to calculate relative risk (RR) from prevalence data and the inverse generic variance method where adjusted odds ratios (aORs) from individual studies were combined.
A total of 18 new studies were included, along with the 22 studies from the 2013 review. Previously observed increased risks remained for perinatal mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 1.23 n = 16 studies; aOR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.98-1.17 n = 6), congenital malformations (RR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.32-1.40 n = 17; aOR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.38-1.47 n = 6), and neonatal hospitalization (RR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.25-1.30 n = 12; aOR 1.1, 95% CI: 1.07-1.16 n = 3) amongst infants born to mothers with asthma, while the risk for neonatal death was no longer significant (RR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.95-1.84 n = 8). Previously reported non-significant risks for major congenital malformations (RR1.18, 95% CI: 1.15-1.21; aOR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.15-1.26 n = 3) and respiratory distress syndrome (RR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.17-1.34 n = 4; aOR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18 n = 2) reached statistical significance.

Therefore, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and asthma remains uncertain.
We performed two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the potential causal relationships between gut microbiota and asthma as well as its phenotypes. We also conducted MR analysis to evaluate the causal effect of gut metabolites on asthma. Genetic variants for gut microbiota were obtained from the MiBioGen consortium, GWAS summary statistics for metabolites from the TwinsUK study and KORA study, and GWAS summary statistics for asthma from the FinnGen consortium. The causal associations between gut microbiota, gut metabolites and asthma were examined using inverse variance weighted, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted model and further validated by MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, and ""leave-one-out"" sensitivity analysis.
We identified nine gut microbes whose genetically predicted relative abundance causally impacted asthma risk. After FDR correction, significant causal relationships were observed for two of these microbes, namely the class Bacilli (OR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.76-0.94, p = 1.98 × 10

38326156,Inhaled medications and inhalation chambers for childhood asthma. Spanish network of working groups on asthma in pediatrics (REGAP).,2024-02-08,"Asthma, the most prevalent chronic disease in pediatric age, continues to pose challenges in its management and treatment. National and international guidelines emphasize the importance of therapeutic education (TE) to achieve disease control. TE involves imparting knowledge and skills to the patient and their family, enhancing medication adherence, rectifying errors in inhalation technique, and tailoring treatment based on individual patient characteristics. It is essential for TE to be progressive, gradual, and personalized, spanning all levels of care. Training healthcare professionals in TE is crucial, particularly for pediatricians, who must also be aware of the extensive variability of available meds and inhalers and their respective age-specific indications. Addressing this need, the REGAP Group extensively reviewed inhalers currently available in Spain for pediatric asthma treatment. The review encompassed different inhalation systems and inhaled drugs used for pediatric asthma treatment. This review will be updated annually, providing information on medications, devices, inhalation chambers, indications, and financiation. The REGAP Group hopes that these tables will be a valuable help for pediatricians in their daily clinical practice and serve as an effective TE tool.",,"[{'lastname': 'Juliá Benito', 'firstname': 'Juan Carlos', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Centro de Salud República Argentina, Valencia, Spain; Unidad de Alergia y Neumología Pediátrica, Hospital IMED, Valencia, Spain.

To describe and compare the content and quality of clinical guidelines for the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in children between geographic regions.
Observational study of guidelines for the management of acute paediatric asthma from institutions across a global collaboration of six regional paediatric emergency research networks.
158 guidelines were identified. Half provided recommendations for at least two age groups, and most guidelines provided treatment recommendations according to asthma severity.There were consistent recommendations for the use of inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids. Inhaled anticholinergic therapy was recommended in most guidelines for severe and critical asthma, but there were inconsistent recommendations for its use in mild and moderate exacerbations. Other inhaled therapies such as helium-oxygen mixture (Heliox) and nebulised magnesium were inconsistently recommended for severe and critical illness.Parenteral bronchodilator therapy and epinephrine were mostly reserved for severe and critical asthma, with intravenous magnesium most recommended. There were regional differences in the use of other parenteral bronchodilators, particularly aminophylline.Guideline quality assessment identified high ratings for clarity of presentation, scope and purpose, but low ratings for stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, applicability and editorial independence.

38325715,Pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of neuropeptide S system in neurological disorders.,2024-02-08,"Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a 20 amino acids-containing neuroactive molecule discovered by the reverse pharmacology method. NPS is detected in specific brain regions like the brainstem, amygdala, and hypothalamus, while its receptor (NPSR) is ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Besides CNS, NPS and NPSR are also expressed in the peripheral nervous system. NPSR is a G-protein coupled receptor that primarily uses Gq and Gs signaling pathways to mediate the actions of NPS. In animal models of Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease, NPS exerts neuroprotective effects. NPS suppresses oxidative stress, anxiety, food intake, and pain, and promotes arousal. NPSR facilitates reward, reinforcement, and addiction-related behaviors. Genetic variation and single nucleotide polymorphism in NPSR are associated with depression, schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. NPS interacts with several neurotransmitters including glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. It also modulates the immune system via augmenting pro-inflammatory cytokines and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. In the present review, we discussed the distribution profile of NPS and NPSR, signaling pathways, and their importance in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders.

This study examined the effect of a smartphone asthma app on asthma control and quality of life.
Using block randomization, 60 patients with asthma were allocated to an intervention group (n = 30) or control group (n = 30) for this single-blind randomized controlled trial. At baseline, both groups completed the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire-Marks (AQLQ-M). The intervention group used a smartphone-based asthma self-management app plus their regular treatment, while the control group received only usual care. Follow-up ACT and AQLQ-M assessments occurred at 3 and 6 months. SPSS version 26 was used for analysis, including descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U), and analysis of variance with repeated measurements.
Both groups showed improved asthma control and quality of life at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline. However, after 6 months the intervention group had significantly greater improvement than controls (p < 0.05). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed divergent changes in ACT and AQLQ-M scores over time, with the intervention group demonstrating greater enhancement of asthma control and quality of life (p < 0.001).

Analysis of the information collected in a clinical registry of patients referred to a specialized HF unit from January-2010 to June-2012. Clinical profile, treatment and prognosis of patients was evaluated, according to the presence of COPD or asthma. Survival analyses were conducted by means of Kaplan-Meier and Cox´s methods. Median follow-up was 1493 days.
We studied 2577 patients, of which 251 (9.7%) presented COPD and 96 (3.7%) bronchial asthma. Significant differences among study groups were observed regarding to the prescription of beta-blockers (COPD = 89.6%; asthma = 87.5%; no bronchopathy = 94.1%; p = 0.002) and SGLT2 inhibitors (COPD = 35.1%; asthma = 50%; no bronchopathy = 38.3%; p = 0.036). Also, patients with bronchial disease received less frequently a defibrillator (COPD = 20.3%; asthma = 20.8%; no broncopathy = 29%; p = 0.004).

A total of 135 young adults between the ages of 13 and 17 were analyzed. There were a total of 46 adolescents diagnosed with somatoform respiratory disorders (SRD), 45 adolescents diagnosed with bronchial asthma (BA), and 44 adolescents diagnosed with pneumonia. The Spielberger-Khanin anxiety questionnaire and the Nijmegen hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) scale were used for the research and diagnosis, respectively. The quality of life was measured using the asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ). In comparison to adults with asthma (33.2%) and pneumonia (32.3%), adults with SRD (34.5%). There were mild immediate associations between the Spielberger scale and the Nijmegen HVS questionnaire for both trait and state anxiety, and mild inverse correlations between the Spielberger scale and the AQLQ for both state and trait anxiety. Adolescents with anxiety had a higher prevalence of trauma, pain, and social issues than their non-anxious counterparts who were referred to psychiatry. In adolescents, 5.1% had severe trait anxiety, and 19.3% had severe condition anxiety. Adolescents with SRD were twice as likely to suffer from extreme state and trait anxiety as the general population. It is hypothesized that anxiety problems are at the root of HVS and contribute to adults' dissatisfaction with their quality of life due to lung ailments. Although certain adolescents with anxiety disorders were referred for anxiety, this data nevertheless lends credence to the idea that using standardized and structured instruments regularly might help increase accuracy and detection rates in the clinic, regardless of the reason for referral. Complete evaluations are essential for this patient population due to the intricacy of their symptoms.",,"[{'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': '1Department of Pharmacy, Vivekananda Global University, Jaipur, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jain', 'firstname': 'Sh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': '2Department of Paediatrics, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Chandani', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': '3Department of Data Science (DS, AI, CSBS), Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel J', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': '4Department of Pharmacology, Parul University, PO Limda, Tal.

COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the risk of infection and the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis. The aim of our study was to define the relationships between pollen exposures and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in Georgia, as well as to characterize the Covid-19 autoimmune and antiviral responses in Georgian allergic patients with different sensitization patterns. Data on daily COVID-19 positivity rates, case fatality rates, and pollen concentrations from February 2020 to November 2022 were collected in Tbilisi, Kutaisi, and Batumi. Diagnostic parameters, including total IgE, specific IgE, eosinophil counts, anti-nuclear antibodies, and Covid-19 antibodies, were assessed in 181 atopic patients and 24 healthy controls with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory findings revealed significant variations in eosinophil counts and total IgE levels among the groups. ANA positivity did not exhibit substantial differences between atopic patients and healthy controls. Individuals with indoor allergies displayed lower SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels, potentially explained by variations in adaptive immune responses.

38325270,Oxidative stress-mediated activation of FTO exacerbates impairment of the epithelial barrier by up-regulating IKBKB via N6-methyladenosine-dependent mRNA stability in asthmatic mice exposed to PM2.5.,2024-02-08,"In order to comprehend the underlying mechanisms contributing to the development and exacerbation of asthma resulting from exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), we established an asthmatic model in fat mass and obesity-associated gene knockdown mice subjected to PM2.5 exposure. Histological analyses using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining revealed that the down-regulation of the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (Fto) expression significantly ameliorated the pathophysiological alterations observed in asthmatic mice exposed to PM2.5. Furthermore, the down-regulation of Fto gene expression effectively attenuated damage to the airway epithelial barrier. Additionally, employing in vivo and in vitro models, we elucidated that PM2.5 modulated FTO expression by inducing oxidative stress. Asthmatic mice exposed to PM2.5 exhibited elevated Fto expression, which correlated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Similarly, when cells were exposed to PM2.5, FTO expression was up-regulated in a ROS-dependent manner. Notably, the administration of N-acetyl cysteine successfully reversed the PM2.5-induced elevation in FTO expression. Concurrently, we performed transcriptome-wide Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeRIP-seq) analysis subsequent to PM2.5 exposure. Through the implementation of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and m6A-IP-qPCR, we successfully identified inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKBKB) as a target gene regulated by FTO. Interestingly, exposure to PM2.5 led to increased expression of IKBKB, while m6A modification on IKBKB mRNA was reduced. Furthermore, our investigation revealed that PM2.5 also regulated IKBKB through oxidative stress. Significantly, the down-regulation of IKBKB effectively mitigated epithelial barrier damage in cells exposed to PM2.5 by modulating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. Importantly, we discovered that decreased m6A modification on IKBKB mRNA facilitated by FTO enhanced its stability, consequently resulting in up-regulation of IKBKB expression. Collectively, our findings propose a novel role for FTO in the regulation of IKBKB through m6A-dependent mRNA stability in the context of PM2.5-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, it is conceivable that the utilization of antioxidants or inhibition of FTO could represent potential therapeutic strategies for the management of asthma exacerbated by PM2.5 exposure.",,"[{'lastname': 'Xiong', 'firstname': 'Anying', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Laboratory of Allergy and Precision Medicine, Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health, the Third People's Hospital of Chengdu, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Chengdu third people's hospital branch of National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Affiliated Hospital of ChongQing Medical University, Chengdu 610031, China.""}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Xiang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Laboratory of Allergy and Precision Medicine, Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health, the Third People's Hospital of Chengdu, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Chengdu third people's hospital branch of National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Affiliated Hospital of ChongQing Medical University, Chengdu 610031, China; National Center for Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510120, China.

38324665,Emergency management and asthma risk in young Medicaid-enrolled children with recurrent wheeze.,2024-02-07,"To describe clinical characteristics of young children presenting to the emergency department (ED) for early recurrent wheeze, and determine factors associated with subsequent persistent wheeze and risk for early childhood asthma.
Retrospective cohort study of Medicaid-enrolled children 0-3 years old with an index ED visit for wheeze (e.g. bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease) from 2009 to 2013, and at least one prior documented episode of wheeze at an ED or primary care visit. The primary outcome was persistent wheeze between 4 and 6 years of age. Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from the index ED visit. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between potential risk factors and subsequent persistent wheeze.
During the study period, 41,710 children presented to the ED for recurrent wheeze. Mean age was 1.3 years; 59% were male, 42% Black, and 6% Hispanic. At index ED visits, the most common diagnosis was acute bronchiolitis (40%); 77% of children received an oral corticosteroid prescription. Between 4 and 6 years of age, 11,708 (28%) children had persistent wheeze. A greater number of wheezing episodes was associated with an increased odds of ED treatment with asthma medications. Subsequent persistent wheeze was associated with male sex, Black race, atopy, prescription for bronchodilators or corticosteroids, and greater number of visits for wheeze.
Young children with persistent wheeze are at risk for childhood asthma. Thus, identification of risk factors associated with persistent wheeze in young children with recurrent wheeze might aid in early detection of asthma and initiation of preventative therapies.",,"[{'lastname': 'Hardee', 'firstname': 'Isabel J', 'initials': 'IJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, University of CO School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Zaniletti', 'firstname': 'Isabella', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Children's Hospitals Association, Overland Park, KS, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Tanverdi', 'firstname': 'Melisa S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': ""Section of Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Andrew H', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': ""Section of Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO.""}, {'lastname': 'Mistry', 'firstname': 'Rakesh D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Section of Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Navanandan', 'firstname': 'Nidhya', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Section of Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.""}]"

38324365,Physical Activity Intervention for Urban Black Women With Asthma: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Efficacy Study.,2024-02-07,"Black women experience a higher prevalence of poor asthma outcomes and physical inactivity than their White counterparts. Black women comprise a particularly vulnerable group of patients with asthma, with some of the highest rates of asthma in adults, high health care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations), and the highest crude asthma mortality rate of all race or ethnicity groups. Despite recommendations to engage in regular physical activity, fewer than 15% of Black women meet the 2008 National Physical Activity Guidelines, the lowest of all racial subgroups of adults. Given the connection between physical inactivity and poor asthma outcomes, addressing physical activity among Black women with asthma is imperative.
This 2-arm randomized controlled trial aims to (1) determine the efficacy of a lifestyle walking intervention on asthma control compared to an education (control) group over 24 weeks, (2) examine the maintenance effects of the lifestyle walking intervention on asthma control at 48 weeks, (3) explore the behavioral mediators (eg, self-efficacy, social support, self-regulation, and daily physical activity levels) and contextual moderators (eg, baseline asthma severity, neighborhood environment, comorbid conditions, and social determinants of health) that contribute to treatment responsiveness, and (4) assess the reach and implementation potential of the intervention.
The proposed study (ACTION [A Lifestyle Physical Activity Intervention for Minority Women with Asthma]) delivers a 24-week lifestyle walking intervention designed for and by urban Black women with asthma. Participants (n=224) will be recruited through 2 urban health care systems that care for a diverse Black population. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: (1) ACTION intervention (group sessions, physical activity self-monitoring-Fitbit, and text-based support for step goal setting) or (2) education control (an individual asthma education session and SMS text messages related to asthma education). Outcome assessments will take place at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks. The primary outcome is a change in asthma control from baseline to week 24 as assessed by the asthma control questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6). Secondary outcomes include asthma-related quality of life, health care use, and asthma exacerbations and behavioral outcomes such as self-efficacy, self-regulation, social support, and physical activity.
This study was funded by the National Institute of Minority Health Disparities in August 2022. We pilot-tested our recruitment and intervention procedures and began recruitment in April 2023, with the enrollment of our first participant in May 2023. The anticipated completion of the study is April 2027.
This study will deliver a new approach to physical activity interventions in Black women with asthma and help to provide guidance for addressing physical activity within this subgroup. This study will also provide a potential framework for future studies in minoritized populations with other disease conditions associated with low levels of physical activity.

38324179,Advancing Understanding of Childhood Asthma: Lessons Learned from Birth Cohort Studies.,2024-02-07,"Asthma and allergies are some of the most common chronic disorders affecting children, the prevalence of which has been increasing in countries and regions undergoing rapid development like China. To curb the rising tide of allergies and safeguard the health of future generations, it is of critical importance to understand how asthma inception is influenced by factors acting at different life stages. Birth cohorts represent a powerful tool to investigate the temporal sequence of exposures along the natural course of asthma. We examined recent evidence on birth cohort studies of asthma and allergic diseases and evaluated their strengths and weaknesses. Essential elements for a successful birth cohort are proposed to further elucidate asthma etiology and pathogenies.

38324166,State of the art in pediatric nanomedicines.,2024-02-07,"In recent years, the continuous development of innovative nanopharmaceuticals is expanding their biomedical and clinical applications. Nanomedicines are being revolutionized to circumvent the limitations of unbound therapeutic agents as well as overcome barriers posed by biological interfaces at the cellular, organ, system, and microenvironment levels. In many ways, the use of nanoconfigured delivery systems has eased challenges associated with patient differences, and in our opinion, this forms the foundation for their potential usefulness in developing innovative medicines and diagnostics for special patient populations. Here, we present a comprehensive review of nanomedicines specifically designed and evaluated for disease management in the pediatric population. Typically, the pediatric population has distinguishing needs relative to those of adults majorly because of their constantly growing bodies and age-related physiological changes, which often need specialized drug formulation interventions to provide desirable therapeutic effects and outcomes. Besides, child-centric drug carriers have unique delivery routes, dosing flexibility, organoleptic properties (e.g., taste, flavor), and caregiver requirements that are often not met by traditional formulations and can impact adherence to therapy. Engineering pediatric medicines as nanoconfigured structures can potentially resolve these limitations stemming from traditional drug carriers because of their unique capabilities. Consequently, researchers from different specialties relentlessly and creatively investigate the usefulness of nanomedicines for pediatric disease management as extensively captured in this compilation. Some examples of nanomedicines covered include nanoparticles, liposomes, and nanomicelles for cancer; solid lipid and lipid-based nanostructured carriers for hypertension; self-nanoemulsifying lipid-based systems and niosomes for infections; and nanocapsules for asthma pharmacotherapy.",,"[{'lastname': 'Abedin', 'firstname': 'Saba', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, B3H 4R2, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Adeleke', 'firstname': 'Oluwatoyin A', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'College of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, B3H 4R2, Canada. oadeleke@dal.ca.'}]"
38324025,[Allergen-specific immunotherapy : A brief overview in association with allergic conjunctivitis].,2024-02-07,"Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only causal and disease-modifying treatment for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated type I allergies. Regular exposure to the causative allergen results in an immunomodulatory effect by which the predominant T‑helper (Th) 2 lymphocyte response is shifted to a Th1 lymphocyte response and more allergen-specific blocking immunoglobulins are produced. The approval of substances for AIT is regulated by the Therapy Allergens Ordinance (TAV). There are subcutaneous and/or sublingual AITs for the following indications: allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma and insect venom allergy. In this article the indications for allergic conjunctivitis are discussed in particular. Clinical symptoms and a relevant type 1 sensitization are the prerequisites for the indications for AIT. The assessment of the indications and carrying out an AIT should only be carried out by physicians who have been trained in allergology.
Die allergenspezifische Immuntherapie (AIT) ist die einzige kausale und krankheitsmodifizierende Therapie für eine Immunglobulin E (IgE)-vermittelte Allergie vom Typ I. Durch regelmäßige Exposition gegenüber dem Allergen kommt es zu einer immunmodulatorischen Wirkung, wobei sich die Gewichtung von Th2- zu Th1-Lymphozyten verschiebt und vermehrt allergenspezifisch blockierende Immunglobuline produziert werden. Die Zulassung der AIT ist über die Therapieallergene-Verordnung (TAV) geregelt. Es gibt subkutane und/oder sublinguale AITs für folgende Indikationen: Rhinitis allergica, Conjunctivitis allergica, allergisches Asthma und Insektengiftallergien. Im Folgenden soll insbesondere auf die Indikation der Conjunctivitis allergica eingegangen werden.

In this study, we investigated the B cell immune responses to HBoV1 and HBoV2, representing two different species of bocaviruses in humans.
We analyzed the effects of stimulations with HBoV1 and 2 virus-like particles (VLPs) and of co-stimulation with HBoV1-rhinovirus (RV) on cells of the immune system by flow cytometry, transcriptomics, and luminometric immune assays.
Human B cells, and particularly B regulatory cells (Breg cells), showed an increased immune response to HBoV1-VLPs stimulation. These immune responses were also supported by increased IL-1RA and PDL1 expressions in IL-10
The findings demonstrate that in Breg cells, IL-10 signalling pathways, and anti-inflammatory activity are induced by HBoV1, which can explain the often mild nature of the disease.

38320720,Targeting Asthma Remission as the Next Therapeutic Step Toward Improving Disease Control.,2024-02-07,"The long-term goal of asthma management is to achieve disease control, comprising the assessment of 2 main domains: (1) symptom control and (2) future risk of adverse outcomes. Decades of progress in asthma management have correlated with increasingly ambitious disease control targets. Moreover, the introduction of precision medicines, such as biologics, has further expanded the limits of what can be achieved in terms of disease control. It is now believed that clinical remission, a term rarely associated with asthma, may be an achievable treatment goal. An expert framework published in 2020 took the first step toward developing a commonly accepted definition of clinical remission in asthma. However, there remains a widespread discussion about the clinical parameters and thresholds that should be included in a standardized definition of clinical remission. This review aims to discuss on-treatment clinical remission as an aspirational outcome in asthma management, drawing on experiences from other chronic diseases where remission has long been a goal. We also highlight the integral role of shared decision-making between patients and health care professionals and the need for a common understanding of the individual patient journey to remission as foundational elements in reducing disease burden and improving outcomes for patients with asthma.",,"[{'lastname': 'Busse', 'firstname': 'William W', 'initials': 'WW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.'}, {'lastname': 'Chupp', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Yale Center for Asthma and Airways Disease (YCAAD), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Conn.'}, {'lastname': 'Corbridge', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Medical Affairs, GSK, Durham, NC.'}, {'lastname': 'Stach-Klysh', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Medical Affairs, GSK, Durham, NC.'}, {'lastname': 'Oppenheimer', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ.

Tissue EoE pathology has previously been extensively characterized by novel transcriptomics and proteomic platforms, however the majority of surface marker determination and screening has been performed in blood due to mucosal tissue size limitations. While eosinophils, CD4
In this study, we aimed to comprehensively analyze the composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and their activation using surface marker measurements with multicolor flow cytometry simultaneously in both blood and mucosal tissue of patients with active EoE, inactive EoE, patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and controls. Moreover, we set out to validate our data in co-cultures of PBMC with human primary esophageal epithelial cells and in a novel inducible mouse model of eosinophilic esophagitis, characterized by extensive IL-33 secretion in the esophagus.
Our results indicate that specific PBMC populations are enriched, and that they alter their surface expression of activation markers in mucosal tissue of active EoE. In particular, we observed upregulation of the immunomodulatory molecule CD38 on CD4

38318088,"Smoking, Urban Housing and Work-Aggravated Asthma are Associated with Asthma Severity in a Cross-Sectional Observational Study.",2024-02-06,"Severe asthma affects 5 to 10% of asthmatics and accounts for a large part of asthma-related morbidity and costs. The determinants of asthma severity are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that asthma severity was associated with 1) atopy and allergy and 2) markers associated with environmental exposure.
Data from the FASE-CPHG study, a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter investigation, were analyzed to identify markers associated with asthma severity. Asthma severity was gauged using the ASSESS score, encompassing symptom control, exacerbations, FEV1 and therapeutic load. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify patient characteristics associated with the ASSESS score.
The analysis involved 948 patients, with 592 women, of which 447 patients (47%) had severe asthma. Among these, 491 patients (52%) had at least one positive aeroallergen skin prick test and 525 (55%) had at least one allergic disease among atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinitis and food allergy. The mean±SD ASSESS score was 11.2±3.4. Characteristics associated with a higher ASSESS score were female sex, secondary or lower education, unemployed occupational status, smoking, work-aggravated asthma and urban housing. There was no association between the ASSESS score and allergic diseases, aeroallergen-specific skin prick tests and IgEs, or blood eosinophil counts.
While atopy and allergy were frequent among asthmatics, neither was associated with asthma severity. Modifiable environmental factors such as smoking, urban housing and work-aggravated asthma were independently associated with asthma severity.","While atopy and allergy were frequent among asthmatics, neither was associated with asthma severity.

Data on five serum carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lycopene) were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2006. Mortality data was extracted from the pertinent mortality records within the NHANES database, up to December 31, 2019. Logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the association between serum carotenoid concentrations and asthma prevalence. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the connection between serum carotenoids and mortality rates in asthma individuals.
Among the study population, 1569 (12.63 %) individuals were diagnosed with asthma, while 25.01 % of asthma patients died within a median follow-up duration of 15.5 (13.8-17.3) years. After controlling for all other variables, greater serum levels of certain carotenoids, such asα-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin, were found to be substantially linked with a decreased prevalence of asthma. Furthermore, persons with asthma who had greater levels of serum carotenoids in the fourth quartile had a significantly lower risk of all-cause death compared to those in the first quartile. Specifically, the presence of α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality by 45 % (HR = 0.55 [0.36-0.84],

38317969,The urinary metabolites of volatile organic compounds and asthma in young children: NHANES 2011-2018.,2024-02-06,"The vast majority of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are of biological origin and do not affect human health, while some VOCs or their oxidation products can damage the respiratory system, nervous system, digestive system and blood system after long-term inhalation by humans. There is limited evidence regarding the association of VOCs exposure with childhood asthma. In this study, we examined the associations between metabolites of VOCs (mVOCs) in urine and childhood asthma. We included a total of 1542 children aged 3-12 years who had information on urinary mVOCs, asthma and essential covariates in the current analyses. After controlling for covariates, we used logistic regression to assess the association between urinary mVOCs and childhood asthma. Then, we examined effect measure modification by child age, gender, race/ethnicity and serum cotinine. 2-Methylhippuric acid (xylene metabolites) (OR: 1.14; 95 % CI: 0.87, 1.59), N-acetyl-S-(benzyl)-l-cysteine (toluene metabolites) (OR: 1.15 95 % CI: 0.76, 1.71), N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxyethyl)-l-cysteine (acrolein metabolites) (OR: 1.09; 95 % CI: 0.61, 1.75), N-acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-l-cysteine (acrolein metabolites) (OR: 1.10; 95 % CI: 0.66, 1.80), and N-acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl-1-methyl)-l-cysteine (crotonaldehyde metabolites) (OR: 1.18; 95 % CI: 0.68, 2.01) were weakly associated with the prevalence of asthma in children. Among female children, 2MHA (2-methylhippuric acid) in urine was significantly associated with the prevalence of asthma (OR: 1.81 95 % CI: 1.07, 3.05). At the same time, BMA (N-acetyl-S-(benzyl)-l-cysteine) was significantly associated with the prevalence of asthma in non-Hispanic White (OR:2.09 95 % CI: 0.91, 4.66) and Black (OR:1.90 95 % CI: 0.96, 3.71) children.

38317769,Blood transcriptome differentiates clinical clusters for asthma.,2024-02-06,"In previous studies, several asthma phenotypes were identified using clinical and demographic parameters. Transcriptional phenotypes were mainly identified using sputum and bronchial cells.
We aimed to investigate asthma phenotypes via clustering analysis using clinical variables and compare the transcription levels among clusters using gene expression profiling of the blood.
Clustering analysis was performed using 6 parameters: age of asthma onset, body mass index, pack-years of smoking, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/forced vital capacity, and blood eosinophil counts. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood samples and RNA was extracted from selected PBMCs. Transcriptional profiles were generated (Illumina NovaSeq 6000) and analyzed using the reference genome and gene annotation files (hg19.refGene.gft). Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using GO, KEGG, and REACTOME databases.
In total, 355 patients with asthma were included in the analysis, of whom 72 (20.3%) had severe asthma. Clustering of the 6 parameters revealed 4 distinct subtypes. Cluster 1 (n = 63) had lower predicted FEV1 % and higher pack-years of smoking and neutrophils in sputum. Cluster 2 (n = 43) had a higher proportion and number of eosinophils in sputum and blood, and severe airflow limitation. Cluster 3 (n = 110) consisted of younger subjects with atopic features. Cluster 4 (n = 139) included features of late-onset mild asthma. Differentially expressed genes between clusters 1 and 2 were related to inflammatory responses and cell activation. Th17 cell differentiation and interferon gamma-mediated signaling pathways were related to neutrophilic inflammation in asthma.

Approximately one third of AD patients develop a dupilumab-associated ocular surface disease (DAOSD), of which the pathomechanism is poorly understood. This study aimed at investigating inflammatory markers in tear fluids of patients on dupilumab therapy.
Tear fluids were collected from AD patients with DAOSD (ADwDAOSD), AD patients without DAOSD (ADw/oDAOSD), and non-AD patients before and during dupilumab therapy, and analyzed using a specialized proteomic approach quantifying inflammatory markers. The ocular surface microbiome was determined by next generation sequencing technology.
Upon dupilumab therapy, an upregulation of 31 inflammatory markers was observed in DAOSD tear fluids compared to baseline in AD patients. While IL-12B was upregulated in both ADwDAOSD and ADw/oDAOSD groups, the pattern of inflammatory markers significantly differed between groups and over time. In the ADwDAOSD group, a shift from a mixed Th2/Th17 pattern at baseline toward a Th1/Th17 profile under dupilumab was observed. Furthermore, an upregulation of remodeling and fibrosis markers was seen in DAOSD. Semantic map and hierarchical cluster analyses of baseline marker expression revealed four clusters distinguishing between AD and non-AD as well as ADwDAOSD and ADw/oDAOSD patient groups. In a pilot study, dupilumab therapy was associated with a decrease in richness of the ocular surface microbiome.

38317239,Single-cell analysis reveals alterations in cellular composition and cell-cell communication associated with airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma.,2024-02-06,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by airway inflammation and remodeling, whose pathogenetic complexity was associated with abnormal responses of various cell types in the lung. The specific interactions between immune and stromal cells, crucial for asthma pathogenesis, remain unclear. This study aims to determine the key cell types and their pathological mechanisms in asthma through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).
A 16-week mouse model of house dust mite (HDM) induced asthma (n = 3) and controls (n = 3) were profiled with scRNA-seq. The cellular composition and gene expression profiles were assessed by bioinformatic analyses, including cell enrichment analysis, trajectory analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Cell-cell communication analysis was employed to investigate the ligand-receptor interactions.
The asthma model results in airway inflammation coupled with airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness. Single-cell analysis revealed notable changes in cell compositions and heterogeneities associated with airway inflammation and remodeling. GdT17 cells were identified to be a primary cellular source of IL-17, related to inflammatory exacerbation, while a subpopulation of alveolar macrophages exhibited numerous significantly up-regulated genes involved in multiple pathways related to neutrophil activities in asthma. A distinct fibroblast subpopulation, marked by elevated expression levels of numerous contractile genes and their regulators, was observed in increased airway smooth muscle layer by immunofluorescence analysis. Asthmatic stromal-immune cell communication significantly strengthened, particularly involving GdT17 cells, and macrophages interacting with fibroblasts. CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was remarkedly up-regulated in asthma, predominantly bridging the interaction between fibroblasts and immune cell populations. Fibroblasts and macrophages could jointly interact with various immune cell subpopulations via the CCL8/CCR2 signaling. In particular, fibroblast-macrophage cell circuits played a crucial role in the development of airway inflammation and remodeling through IL1B paracrine signaling.
Our study established a mouse model of asthma that recapitulated key pathological features of asthma.

38316709,Does having siblings really protect against childhood atopic diseases? A total population and within-family analysis.,2024-02-06,"The association between having older siblings and decreased risk for atopic symptoms is well-established. This has been interpreted as evidence for the microbiota hypothesis, i.e. that increased early-childhood microbial exposure caused by siblings protects from immune hypersensitivities. However, possible confounders of the association have received little attention. We used register data on Finnish cohorts born in 1995-2004 (N = 559,077) to assess medication purchases for atopic diseases: antihistamines, eczema medication, asthma medication and Epinephrine. We modelled the probability of atopic medication purchases at ages 0-15 by birth order controlling for important observed confounders and all unobserved genetic and environmental characteristics shared by siblings in a within-family fixed effects model. We further studied medication purchases among first-borns according to the age difference with younger siblings to assess whether having younger siblings in early childhood is beneficial. Having older siblings was associated with a lower probability of atopic medication purchases. Compared to first-borns, the probability was 10-20% lower among second-borns, 20-40% lower among third-borns, and 30-70% lower among subsequent children, depending on medication type. Confounding accounted for up to 75% of these differences, particularly for asthma and eczema medication, but significant differences by birth order remained across all medication types. Among first-borns, a smaller age difference with younger siblings was related to a lower likelihood of atopic medication use. Our results, based on designs that account for unobserved confounding, show that exposure to siblings in early childhood, protects from atopic diseases, and thus strongly support the microbiota hypothesis.",,"[{'lastname': 'Luukkonen', 'firstname': 'Juha', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Population Research Unit, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. juha.x.luukkonen@helsinki.fi.\nMax Planck-University of Helsinki Center for Social Inequalities in Population Health, Helsinki, Finland. juha.x.luukkonen@helsinki.fi.'}, {'lastname': 'Moustgaard', 'firstname': 'Heta', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Population Research Unit, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. heta.moustgaard@helsinki.fi.\nMax Planck-University of Helsinki Center for Social Inequalities in Population Health, Helsinki, Finland. heta.moustgaard@helsinki.fi.\nHelsinki Institute for Social Sciences and Humanities, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. heta.moustgaard@helsinki.fi.'}, {'lastname': 'Martikainen', 'firstname': 'Pekka', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Population Research Unit, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nMax Planck-University of Helsinki Center for Social Inequalities in Population Health, Helsinki, Finland.\nMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Remes', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Population Research Unit, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nMax Planck-University of Helsinki Center for Social Inequalities in Population Health, Helsinki, Finland.'}]"
38316671,Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy Alleviates Ovalbumin-Induced Chronic Airway Remodeling by Suppressing M2 Macrophage Polarization.,2024-02-06,"Chronic asthma is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, and remodeling. Previous studies have shown that mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) exert anti-inflammatory effects on asthma via regulation of the immune cells. However, the therapeutic mechanism of MSCs, especially the mechanism of airway remodeling in chronic asthma, remains to be elucidated. Here, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of MSCs on airway remodeling in chronic asthma and explored the mechanisms by analyzing the polarization phenotype of macrophages in the lungs. We established a mouse model of chronic asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA) and evaluated the effect of MSCs on airway remodeling. The data showed that MSCs treatment before the challenge exerted protective effects on OVA-induced chronic asthma, i.e., decreased the inflammatory cell infiltration, Th2 cytokine levels, subepithelial extracellular matrix deposition, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling. Additionally, we found that MSCs treatment markedly suppressed macrophage M2 polarization in lung tissue. At the same time, MSCs treatment inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, ER stress, and oxidative stress in the OVA-induced chronic allergic airway remodeling mice model. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that MSCs treatment prevents OVA-induced chronic airway remodeling by suppressing macrophage M2 polarization, which may be associated with the dual inhibition of ER stress and oxidative stress. This discovery may provide a new theoretical basis for the future clinical application of MSCs.",,"[{'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Haiyang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1665 KongJiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Guiyin', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1665 KongJiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Qiangqiang', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1665 KongJiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xueting', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1665 KongJiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Xuejun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1665 KongJiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China. guoxuejun@xinhuamed.com.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Gu', 'firstname': 'Wen', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1665 KongJiang Road, Shanghai, 200092, China. guwen@xinhuamed.com.cn.'}]"

The most obvious diagnosis is the most likely and should be addressed first. Ockham's razor, or parsimonious medicine, should be applied because plurality of diagnoses is less likely than a single explanation. Component resolved diagnostics and highly effective biological therapies for allergy/immune mediated diseases have been highly effective when used by specialist allergy services. However, they are accessed too easily and frequently, either before diagnostically appropriate allergy skin testing and challenge have been employed or before the reasons for poor disease control have been investigated. The current fashion to test for vitamin D insufficiency in patients with poorly controlled allergic diseases has rarely achieved benefit but significantly increased costs. There are considerable health/economic benefits from following the proven value of a thorough clinical history, examination, focused allergy/immunology testing and the judicious use of Ockham's razor.",,"[{'lastname': 'Warner', 'firstname': 'John O', 'initials': 'JO', 'affiliation': 'Emeritus Professor of Paediatrics National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London, Hon.

38316016,Efficacy of dupilumab and risk factors for dupilumab-induced hypereosinophilia in severe asthma: a preliminary study from China.,2024-02-05,"Dupilumab has been approved for the treatment of severe asthma with type 2 inflammation by inhibiting interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 signaling. However, dupilumab-induced hypereosinophilia (HE) has been reported and should not be ignored. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of dupilumab in Chinese patients with severe asthma, whether HE affects its efficacy, and the possible risk factors for HE.
20 patients with severe asthma who received dupilumab treatment for at least 12 months in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from 2019 to 2022 were included. We compared clinical data and laboratory tests results before dupilumab treatment and at 4 and 12 months after treatment. Based on whether dupilumab treatment triggers HE defined as blood eosinophil count (BEC) ≥ 1.5 × 10
The patients showed a significant increase in asthma control test (ACT) scores, a decrease in the number of exacerbations, a decrease in the proportion of patients taking an oral corticosteroid (OCS) and in the dose, and a significant improvement in the pulmonary function parameters FEV1/FVC (%) and FEV1 (% predicted) after 4 and 12 months of treatment with dupilumab. For type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, the levels of fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), sputum eosinophil count percentage (SEC%) and total immunoglobulin E (TIgE) decreased significantly, whereas BEC were higher after 4 months of treatment, but returned to baseline levels after 12 months. 8 patients (40%) developed asymptomatic HE after dupilumab, and the efficacy was not significantly different between the HE and non-HE groups. The earliest BEC elevation appeared at 1 month after treatment, but most of them declined after 6 months, and basically returned to the baseline level around 12 months of treatment. In addition, we further found that when patients had FeNO ≥ 60 ppb, food allergens positive and combined eosinophilic otitis media (EOM), their BEC increased significantly more than that of the control group after 4 months as well as 12 months of treatment.
This study demonstrated that dupilumab was efficacious in Chinese patients with severe asthma, and some patients developed asymptomatic, self-limited HE, which did not affect its efficacy. Additionally, FeNO ≥60 ppb, food allergens positive, and co-morbidities with EOM may be the risk factors for developing HE.",,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'You', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.\nDepartment of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shenzhen Guangming District People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Deng', 'firstname': 'Zhenan', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wen', 'firstname': 'Junjie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ou', 'firstname': 'Changxing', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cen', 'firstname': 'Xiaomin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liao', 'firstname': 'Yongkang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Qingling', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Jiaxing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, National Center for Respiratory Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}]"
38315810,Alternative Splicing Is a Major Factor Shaping Transcriptome Diversity in Mild and Severe COPD.,2024-02-05,"The role of alternative splicing in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is still largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the differences in alternatively splicing events between patients with mild-to-moderate and severe COPD compared to non-COPD controls and to identify splicing factors associated with aberrant alternative splicing in COPD. For this purpose, we performed genome-wide RNA-seq analysis of bronchial brushings from 23 mild-to-moderate, 121 severe COPD patients, and 23 non-COPD controls. We found a significant difference in the frequency of alternative splicing events in mild-to-moderate and severe COPD compared to non-COPD controls. There were from 2x to 8x (depending on event type) more differential alternative splicing events in the severe than in the mild-to-moderate stage. The samples from severe COPD patients showed less intron retention and more exon skipping. Interestingly, the transcript levels of the top 10 differentially expressed splicing factors were significantly correlated with the percentage of many alternatively spliced transcripts in severe COPD. The aberrant alternative splicing in severe COPD was predicted to increase the overall protein-coding capacity of gene products. In conclusion, we observed large and significant differences in alternative splicing between bronchial samples of COPD and control individuals, with more events observed in severe than in mild-to-moderate COPD. The changes in the expression of several splicing factors correlated with prevalence of alternative splicing in severe COPD. Alternative splicing can indirectly impact gene expression by changing the relative abundance of protein-coding isoforms potentially influencing pathophysiological changes.

38315527,Profiles of Cough and Associated Risk Factors in Nonhospitalized Individuals With SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant Infection: Cross-Sectional Online Survey in China.,2024-02-05,"Cough is a common symptom during and after COVID-19 infection; however, few studies have described the cough profiles of COVID-19.
The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, severity, and associated risk factors of severe and persistent cough in individuals with COVID-19 during the latest wave of the Omicron variant in China.
In this nationwide cross-sectional study, we collected information of the characteristics of cough from individuals with infection of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant using an online questionnaire sent between December 31, 2022, and January 11, 2023.
There were 11,718 (n=7978, 68.1% female) nonhospitalized responders, with a median age of 37 (IQR 30-47) years who responded at a median of 16 (IQR 12-20) days from infection onset to the time of the survey. Cough was the most common symptom, occurring in 91.7% of participants, followed by fever, fatigue, and nasal congestion (68.8%-87.4%). The median cough visual analog scale (VAS) score was 70 (IQR 50-80) mm. Being female (odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.20-1.43), having a COVID-19 vaccination history (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.37-2.12), current smoking (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.58), chronic cough (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.69-2.45), coronary heart disease (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.17-2.52), asthma (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.46), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.45) were independent factors for severe cough (VAS>70, 37.4%). Among all respondents, 35.0% indicated having a productive cough, which was associated with risk factors of being female (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.31-1.57), having asthma (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.52-2.22), chronic cough (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.74), and GERD (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47). Persistent cough (>3 weeks) occurred in 13.0% of individuals, which was associated with the risk factors of having diabetes (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.30-3.85), asthma (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.62), and chronic cough (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.32-2.94).
Cough is the most common symptom in nonhospitalized individuals with Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant infection.

38315435,Neonatal IL-4 Over-Exposure is Accompanied by Macrophage Accumulation in Dura Mater After Instant Anti-inflammatory Cytokine Response in CSF.,2024-02-05,"Multiple studies have shown that clinical events resulting into neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, such as asthma in early life and food allergy, were associated with brain damage and that the neuroinflammation induced by them might lead to cognitive impairments, anxiety-/depressive-like behaviors. IL-4 is the most major elevated cytokine in periphery when these clinical events occur and peripheral IL-4 level positively correlates with the severity of those events. Our previous studies have verified that neonatal IL-4 over-exposure induced a delayed neuroinflammatory damage in rodents, which might have adverse implications for brain development and cognition. Neuroinflammation in brain parenchyma is often accompanied by changes in CSF cytokines levels. However, whether the cytokines levels in CSF change after neonatal IL-4 over-exposure is unknown. Here, we found a delayed pro-inflammatory cytokines response (higher IL-6, IL-1β and, TNF levels) in both hippocampus and CSF after an instant anti-inflammatory cytokine response in IL-4 over-exposed rats. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory cytokines response appeared earlier in CSF than in hippocampus. The level of each of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in CSF positively correlated with that in hippocampus at the age of postnatal day 42. More microglia numbers/activation and higher M-CSF level in the hippocampus in IL-4 over-exposed rats were also observed. Furthermore, there were more macrophages with inflammatory activation in dural mater of IL-4 over-exposed rats. In sum, neonatal IL-4 over-exposure in rats induces delayed inflammation in CSF, suggesting CSF examination may serve as a potential method in predicting delayed neuroinflammation in brain following neonatal IL-4 over-exposure.",,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ling', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Grade 2019, School of Clinical Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Sha', 'firstname': 'Haoran', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Grade 2020, School of Clinical Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, 510006, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Yinyin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Grade 2018, School of Clinical Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Deng', 'firstname': 'Jiapeng', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Grade 2018, School of Clinical Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Jiexuan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Grade 2020, School of Clinical Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Guoying', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Medical Association, Guangzhou, 510180, Guangdong, China. gzlgying820@163.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Junhua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, 510006, Guangdong, People's Republic of China. jhyang2018@gdpu.edu.cn.\nGuangdong Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, 510006, Guangdong, People's Republic of China. jhyang2018@gdpu.edu.cn.""}]"
38315290,Social Determinants of Health and Allergic Disease Prevalence Among Asian American Children.,2024-02-05,"Although racial and ethnic disparities in allergic diseases have previously been observed, the relationship between social determinants of health (SDoH) and allergic disease prevalence among disaggregated Asian American (AsA) subgroups is poorly understood.
To examine the association of SDoH with allergic disease prevalence among disaggregated AsA subgroups.
Using the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey, we examined caregiver-reported race and ethnicity, SDoH, and allergic diseases. We compared survey-weighted allergic disease prevalence by AsA subgroup. Subgroup-stratified multivariable logistic regression accounting for age, sex, child/parent nativity, and survey year modeled the association between SDoH and allergic disease prevalence. We provide predicted probabilities of having each allergic disease based on exposure to each SDoH.
We examined data from 5042 non-Hispanic AsA children representing 3,264,768 AsA children. Approximately 25% of all AsA children reported at least one allergic disease, ranging from 20% of Asian Indian children to 30% of Filipino/a children. The number of unfavorable SDoH was lowest among Asian Indian and Chinese children (mean 0.7) and highest among ""other Asian"" children (mean 1.2). In stratified analyses, financial instability and inaccessible healthcare were associated with greater probability of allergic diseases among some, but not all AsA subgroups. Lower parent education level, food insecurity, and rent/other housing arrangement were associated with lower probability of allergic disease among some AsA children.
There was heterogeneity in the association of SDoH and allergic disease prevalence among AsA children.

This study depicts the lack of attention to asthma within the otorhinolaryngological field, and the relationship between CRS and asthma, including the risk of revision surgery in such patients.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) because of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps in a five-year period. Patients were examined for adherence to guidelines, asthma, revision FESS, allergies and septo-/turbinoplasty. Results were compared to international reports.
A total of 589 patients had FESS because of CRS of whom 203 (34.5%) had co-existing asthma. A higher risk of asthma (relative risk (RR) = 1.82 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-2.56), p less-than 0.001) and revision FESS (RR = 2.20 (95% CI: 1.33-3.65), p less-than 0.001) was found in patients with CRSwNP. Attention to asthma was poor in patients with no asthma diagnosis before referral.
Asthma was lower in the study population than in the literature. Danish national guidelines on CRS management are insufficient regarding attention to asthma. Results call attention to the need for more multidisciplinary team management.

38311961,Heterogeneity of sensitization profiles and clinical phenotypes among patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis in Southern European countries-The @IT.2020 multicenter study.,2024-02-05,"Pollen allergy poses a significant health and economic burden in Europe. Disease patterns are relatively homogeneous within Central and Northern European countries. However, no study broadly assessed the features of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) across different Southern European countries with a standardized approach.
To describe sensitization profiles and clinical phenotypes of pollen allergic patients in nine Southern European cities with a uniform methodological approach.
Within the @IT.2020 multicenter observational study, pediatric and adult patients suffering from SAR were recruited in nine urban study centers located in seven countries. Clinical questionnaires, skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) tests with a customized multiplex assay (Euroimmun Labordiagnostika, Lübeck, Germany) were performed.
Three hundred forty-eight children (mean age 13.1 years, SD: 2.4 years) and 467 adults (mean age 35.7 years SD: 10.0 years) with a predominantly moderate to severe, persistent phenotype of SAR were recruited. Grass pollen major allergenic molecules (Phl p 1 and/or Phl p 5) ranged among the top three sensitizers in all study centers. Sensitization profiles were very heterogeneous, considering that patients in Rome were highly poly-sensitized (sIgE to 3.8 major allergenic molecules per patient), while mono-sensitization was prominent and heterogeneous in other cities, such as Marseille (sIgE to Cup a 1: n = 55/80, 68.8%) and Messina (sIgE to Par j 2: n = 47/82, 57.3%). Co-sensitization to perennial allergens, as well as allergic comorbidities also broadly varied between study centers.
In Southern European countries, pollen allergy is heterogeneous in terms of sensitization profiles and clinical manifestations. Despite the complexity, a unique molecular, multiplex, and customized in-vitro IgE test detected relevant sensitization in all study centers. Nevertheless, this geographical diversity in pollen allergic patients imposes localized clinical guidelines and study protocols for clinical trials of SAR in this climatically complex region.",,"[{'lastname': 'Dramburg', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Respiratory Care, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Charité -

38311747,Real-world outcomes of mepolizumab for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma in Canada: an observational study.,2024-02-05,"Mepolizumab, the first widely available anti-interleukin 5 biologic, targets eosinophilic inflammation and has been shown in clinical trials to reduce exacerbations, oral corticosteroid dependence, and healthcare utilization in patients with severe asthma. The impact of mepolizumab in a real-world, publicly funded healthcare setting is unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of real-world patients receiving mepolizumab, and to compare asthma-related outcomes and associated asthma-related costs before and during mepolizumab use.
This retrospective, observational study in Ontario, Canada, included patients initiating mepolizumab between February 2016 and March 2019. Patients were identified using the mepolizumab patient support program and linked to the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences database of publicly accessed healthcare. Patient outcomes were obtained for 12 months pre- and post-mepolizumab initiation and compared.
A total of 275 patients were enrolled in the overall patient support program cohort (mean [standard deviation] age 57.6 [13.5] years, mean [standard deviation] of the median per-patient eosinophil count 540.4 [491.9] cells/μL). Mepolizumab was associated with reductions in asthma exacerbations (46.1%, P < 0.001) and in the number of asthma-related visits to general practitioners (40.2%, P < 0.001), specialists (27.2%, P < 0.001), and emergency departments (52.1%, P < 0.001). Associated costs were significantly lower post- versus pre-mepolizumab for asthma-related general practitioner and specialist visits, and for all-cause emergency department visits and hospital admissions.
In a real-world population of Canadian patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, the use of mepolizumab within a patient support program reduced asthma exacerbations and decreased asthma-related healthcare resource utilization and associated costs.",,"[{'lastname': 'Chapman', 'firstname': 'Kenneth R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Asthma & Airway Centre, University Health Network, Room 7-451 EW, 399 Bathurst Street, Toronto, ON, M5T 2S8, Canada. ken.chapman.airways@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Cogger', 'firstname': 'Kathryn', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'GSK, Mississauga, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Arthurs', 'firstname': 'Erin', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'GSK, Mississauga, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'LaForty', 'firstname': 'Callahan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'IQVIA, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Golden', 'firstname': 'Shane', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'IQVIA, Montreal, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Millson', 'firstname': 'Bradley', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'IQVIA, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Usuba', 'firstname': 'Koyo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'GSK, Mississauga, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Licskai', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Western University, London, ON, Canada.'}]"

Ultrasound of the chest revealed bilateral irregular pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion. Airway endoscopy and tracheal wash cytology showed severe neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial culture was positive for Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Despite aggressive treatment, the donkey died in 48 hours. On post-mortem examination, the lung was whitish, collapsed, and firm, with fibrotic multifocal nodular areas. Pleural effusion and pleuritis were detected. Histologically, the lung architecture was markedly replaced by interstitial fibrosis. The histological features observed were suggestive of a severe chronic fibrosing interstitial pleuropneumonia with type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and intralesional syncytial cells. Pulmonary fibrosis was associated with the presence of asinine gammaherpesvirus 2 and 5 infection, confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis. The macroscopic and histological pattern of fibrosis was diffuse and interstitial, and the nodular lesions were consistent with spared lung parenchyma, instead of the canonical nodular distribution of the fibrosis observed in equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis. Asinine herpesviral pulmonary fibrosis is uncommon, but should be considered by clinicians in the list of differentials in donkeys with chronic respiratory signs.",,"[{'lastname': 'Imposimato', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences (DIMEVET), University of Bologna, Via Tolara di Sopra, 50, 40064 Ozzano dell'Emilia, Bologna, Italy.

38310974,Epithelial overexpression of IL-33 induces eosinophilic esophagitis dependent on IL-13.,2024-02-05,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an increasingly common inflammatory condition of the esophagus; however, the underlying immunologic mechanisms remain poorly understood. The epithelium-derived cytokine IL-33 is associated with type 2 immune responses and elevated in esophageal biopsies from EoE subjects.
We hypothesized that overexpression of IL-33 by the esophageal epithelium would promote the immunopathology of EoE.
We evaluated the functional consequences of esophageal epithelial overexpression of a secreted and active form of IL-33 (saIL-33) in a novel transgenic mouse, EoE33. EoE33 mice were analyzed for clinical and immunologic phenotypes. Esophageal contractility was assessed. Epithelial cytokine responses were analyzed in three-dimensional organoids. EoE33 phenotypes were further characterized in ST2
EoE33 mice displayed ST2-dependent, EoE-like pathology and failed to thrive. Esophageal tissue remodeling and inflammation included basal zone hyperplasia, eosinophilia, mast cells, and Th2 cells. Marked increases in levels of type 2 cytokines, including IL-13, and molecules associated with immune responses and tissue remodeling were observed. Esophageal organoids suggested reactive epithelial changes. Genetic deletion of IL-13 in EoE33 mice abrogated pathological changes in vivo. EoE33 mice were steroid responsive.
IL-33 overexpression by the esophageal epithelium generated immunopathology and clinical phenotypes resembling human EoE. IL-33 may play a pivotal role in the etiology of EoE by activating the IL-13 pathway. EoE33 mice are a robust experimental platform for mechanistic investigation and translational discovery.",IL-33 overexpression by the esophageal epithelium generated immunopathology and clinical phenotypes resembling human EoE.

38310914,"Estimated health effects from domestic use of gaseous fuels for cooking and heating in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analyses.",2024-02-05,"Exposure to household air pollution from polluting domestic fuel (solid fuel and kerosene) represents a substantial global public health burden and there is an urgent need for rapid transition to clean domestic fuels. Gas for cooking and heating might possibly affect child asthma, wheezing, and respiratory health. The aim of this review was to synthesise the evidence on the health effects of gaseous fuels to inform policies for scalable clean household energy.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarised the health effects from cooking or heating with gas compared with polluting fuels (eg, wood or charcoal) and clean energy (eg, electricity and solar energy). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Environment Complete, GreenFile, Google Scholar, Wanfang DATA, and CNKI for articles published between Dec 16, 2020, and Feb 6, 2021. Studies eligible for inclusion had to compare gas for cooking or heating with polluting fuels (eg, wood or charcoal) or clean energy (eg, electricity or solar energy) and present data for health outcomes in general populations. Studies that reported health outcomes that were exacerbations of existing underlying conditions were excluded. Several of our reviewers were involved in screening studies, data extraction, and quality assessment (including risk of bias) of included studies; 20% of studies were independently screened, extracted and quality assessed by another reviewer. Disagreements were reconciled through discussion with the wider review team. Included studies were appraised for quality using the Liverpool Quality Assessment Tools. Key health outcomes were grouped for meta-analysis and analysed using Cochrane's RevMan software. Primary outcomes were health effects (eg, acute lower respiratory infections) and secondary outcomes were health symptoms (eg, respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, cough, or breathlessness). This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021227092.
116 studies were included in the meta-analysis (two [2%] randomised controlled trials, 13 [11%] case-control studies, 23 [20%] cohort studies, and 78 [67%] cross-sectional studies), contributing 215 effect estimates for five grouped health outcomes. Compared with polluting fuels, use of gas significantly lowered the risk of pneumonia (OR 0·54, 95% CI 0·38-0·77; p=0·00080), wheeze (OR 0·42, 0·30-0·59; p<0·0001), cough (OR 0·44, 0·32-0·62; p<0·0001), breathlessness (OR 0·40, 0·21-0·76; p=0·0052), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 0·37, 0·23-0·60; p<0·0001), bronchitis (OR 0·60, 0·43-0·82; p=0·0015), pulmonary function deficit (OR 0·27, 0·17-0·44; p<0·0001), severe respiratory illness or death (OR 0·27, 0·11-0·63; p=0·0024), preterm birth (OR 0·66, 0·45-0·97; p=0·033), and low birth weight (OR 0·70, 0·53-0·93; p=0·015). Non-statistically significant effects were observed for asthma in children (OR 1·04, 0·70-1·55; p=0·84), asthma in adults (OR 0·65, 0·43-1·00; p=0·052), and small for gestational age (OR 1·04, 0·89-1·21; p=0·62). Compared with electricity, use of gas significantly increased risk of pneumonia (OR 1·26, 1·03-1·53; p=0·025) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1·15, 1·06-1·25; p=0·0011), although smaller non-significant effects were observed for higher-quality studies. In addition, a small increased risk of asthma in children was not significant (OR 1·09, 0·99-1·19; p=0·071) and no significant associations were found for adult asthma, wheeze, cough, and breathlessness (p>0·05). A significant decreased risk of bronchitis was observed (OR 0·87, 0·81-0·93; p<0·0001).
Switching from polluting fuels to gaseous household fuels could lower health risk and associated morbidity and mortality in resource-poor countries where reliance on polluting fuels is greatest. Although gas fuel use was associated with a slightly higher risk for some health outcomes compared with electricity, gas is an important transitional option for health in countries where access to reliable electricity supply for cooking or heating is not feasible in the near term.

38310584,The Association Between Short-Acting β,2024-02-04,"In Australia, short-acting β
This was a cross-sectional study, using data derived from primary care electronic medical records (EMRs) and patient completed questionnaires within Optimum Patient Care Research Database Australia (OPCRDA). A total of 720 individuals aged ≥ 12 years with an asthma diagnosis in their EMRs and receiving asthma therapy were included. The annual number of SABA inhalers authorised on prescription, acquired OTC and reported, and the association with self-reported exacerbations and asthma control were investigated.
92.9% (n = 380/409) of individuals issued with SABA prescription were authorised ≥ 3 inhalers annually, although this differed from self-reported usage. Of individuals reporting SABA use (n = 546) in the last 12 months, 37.0% reported using ≥ 3 inhalers. These patients who reported SABA overuse experienced 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-3.70) times more severe exacerbations and were 4.51 times (95% CI 3.13-6.55) more likely to have poor asthma control than those who reported using 1-2 SABA inhalers. Patients who did not receive SABA on prescription (43.2%; n = 311/720) also experienced 2.71 (95% CI 1.07-7.26) times more severe exacerbations than those prescribed 1-2 inhalers. Of these patients, 38.9% reported using OTC SABA and other prescription medications, 26.4% reported using SABA OTC as their only asthma medication, 13.2% were prescribed other therapies but not SABA OTC and 14.5% were not using any medication.
Both self-reported SABA overuse and zero SABA prescriptions were associated with poor asthma outcomes. The disconnect between prescribing authorisation, OTC availability and actual use, make it difficult for clinicians to quantify SABA use.","Both self-reported SABA overuse and zero SABA prescriptions were associated with poor asthma outcomes.

Participants who were parents of children with a diagnosis of asthma were recruited, and in-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted. The interview transcripts were analyzed thematically using framework methods.
Seventeen participants undertook interviews. Three themes and nine subthemes emerged: (1) decision-making need level-limited understanding of decision-making knowledge, ambiguity regarding self-empowerment roles, and lack of family member support; (2) decision-making support level-insufficient ability to evaluate information, inefficient communication with health care professionals, and excessive use of professional terminology; and (3) decision-making outcome level-doubts about the final decision-making choices, time constraints on decision-making, and absence of mechanisms to track decisions made.

38310368,Intervention with ICOSL Antibodies Alleviates Inflammatory Infiltrations in Mice with Neutrophilic Asthma.,2024-02-04,"Neutrophilic asthma is characterized by the predominant infiltration of neutrophils in airway inflammation.
To explore the therapeutic potential of an antibody against the inducible T cell co-stimulator ligand (ICOSL) in a mouse model of neutrophilic asthma.
Female BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to different groups. They were then injected with ovalbumin (OVA)/lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to induce neutrophilic asthma. The mice were then treated with either anti-ICOSL (the I group), control IgG (the G group), or no treatment (the N group). Additionally, a control group of mice received vehicle PBS and was labeled as the C group (n=6 per group). One day after the last allergen exposure, cytokine levels were measured in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) using ELISA. After analyzing and categorizing BALF cells, the lung tissues were examined histologically and immunohistochemically.
Administering anti-ICOSL resulted in a significant decrease in the total number of inflammatory infiltrates and neutrophils found in BALF. Moreover, it led to a decrease in the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-13, and IL-17 in both BALF and plasma. Additionally, there was an increase in IFN-γ levels in the BALF of asthmatic mice (p<0.05 for all). Treatment with anti-ICOSL also reduced lung interstitial inflammation, mucus secretion, and ICOSL expression in asthmatic mice.
The treatment of anti-ICOSL effectively improved lung interstitial inflammation and mucus secretion in mice with neutrophilic asthma by restoring the balance of Th1/Th2/Th17 responses. These findings indicate that blocking the ICOS/ICOSL signaling could be an effective way to manage neutrophilic asthma.",The treatment of anti-ICOSL effectively improved lung interstitial inflammation and mucus secretion in mice with neutrophilic asthma by restoring the balance of Th1/Th2/Th17 responses.

In Japan, the prevalence of OSA in the general population is reported to be approximately 20%; however, few reports have described the prevalence of OSA in asthma patients. Furthermore, the characteristics of Japanese patients with OSA and asthma are not clear.
Adult asthma patients were recruited from the outpatient departments of our institution between August 31, 2017, and March 31, 2019. In all included patients, the presence and severity of OSA were evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and a home sleep test (HST) using portable polysomnography (PSG).

38310083,Research progress on the pathogenesis of chest tightness variant asthma characterized by chest tightness.,2024-02-04,"Chest tightness variant asthma (CTVA) is an atypical form of asthma with chest tightness as the sole or predominant symptom. The underlying receptors for chest tightness may be bronchial C-fibers or rapidly adapting receptors. The nerve impulses are transmitted via the vagus nerve and processed in different regions of the cerebral cortex. Chest tightness is associated with sensory perception, and CTVA patients may have a heightened ability to detect subtle changes in lung function, which may be unrelated to respiratory muscle activity, lung hyperinflation, or mechanical loading of the respiratory system. The airway inflammation, pulmonary ventilation dysfunction (especially involving small airways), and airway hyperresponsiveness may underlie the sensation of chest tightness. CTVA patients are prone to comorbid anxiety and depression, which share similar central nervous system processing pathways with dyspnea, suggesting a possible neurological basis for the development of CTVA. This article examines the recognition and mechanisms of chest tightness symptoms, and explores the pathogenesis of CTVA, focusing on its association with the airway inflammation, ventilation dysfunction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and psychosocial factors.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the effects of atopic conditions on the severity and recurrence of ocular infections including herpes simplex virus (HSV).
This study was performed on 474 consecutive patients with infectious keratitis caused by bacteria, fungus, acanthamoeba, HSV, or varicella-zoster virus. The relationships between the atopic condition and specific infectious pathogens and HSV were determined using real-time PCR.
Our findings showed that atopic dermatitis (AD) was significantly associated with the incidence of HSV keratitis (odds ratio (OR), 10.2; P = 0.000). Other associations with AD were observed only with bacteria in an adverse manner. HSV proliferation in the lesions of patients with HSV keratitis whose AD was associated with non-infectious atopic blepharitis were significantly greater by 145-folds (P = 0.000). The presence of asthma or allergic rhinitis also increased the HSV DNA copy numbers. A recurrence of HSV keratitis was observed in 70 patients (43.2 %), and mean time to recurrence was 1647 days. Cox proportional hazard model indicated that the epithelial type of HSV recurrence but not the stromal type was associated with atopic conditions especially with AD. The factors significantly associated with a recurrence was AD associated with non-infectious atopic blepharitis (HR: 6.11, P = 0.000) and asthma (HR: 3.03, P = 0.025).

As the number of older people increases, so does the prevalence of lung disease in the elderly, making it essential to understand the pathophysiology of elderly patients with lung disease. Age-related changes in immune system function and lung parenchyma occur throughout a person's life. Immunosenescence refers to the tendency for innate and adaptive immunity to decline in the elderly. As we age, changes in the innate and adaptive immune systems can lead to dysregulation and reduced immune function. A low-level chronic inflammatory state is known as inflamm-aging and is driven by immunosenescence. This review discusses the role of immunosenescence and inflamm-aging in pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung infections. Understanding the different manifestations of lung diseases between the elderly and the young, finding new therapeutic sites, or improving clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients will provide clinicians with new ideas.

38309936,Temporal Association Between Vaping and Risk of Cardiac Events.,2024-02-04,"To describe our early observations with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden death (SD) in patients using vape products.
A retrospective analysis of Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic and Sudden Death Genomics Laboratory was performed on all SCA survivors and decedents who presented between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2021, to identify patients/decedents with a history of vaping. Data abstraction included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and documented use of vape products.
Among 144 SCA survivors and 360 SD victims, there were six individuals (1%; 3 females) with unexplained SCA (n=4) or SD (n=2) that was temporally associated with vaping use with a mean age at sentinel event of 23±5 years. The SCA survivors include a 19-year-old male who was resuscitated from documented ventricular fibrillation 40 minutes after vaping and a 19-year-old male who was resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation a few hours post vaping. The first SD victim was a 19-year-old female with exercise-induced asthma who died in her sleep after vaping that evening. Autopsy results showed eosinophilic infiltrates in the lung tissue and death was attributed to bronchial asthma. The second vaping-associated death involved a 26-year-old male whose autopsy attributed the death to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
We have identified six young individuals with a history of vaping who experienced a near fatal episode or a tragic SD.

38309597,"Farm Animal Exposure, Respiratory Illnesses, and Nasal Cell Gene Expression.",2024-02-04,"Farm exposures in early life reduce the risks for childhood allergic diseases and asthma. There is less information about how farm exposures relate to respiratory illnesses and mucosal immune development.
We hypothesized that children raised in farm environments have a lower incidence of respiratory illnesses over the first two years of life than non-farm children. We also analyzed whether farm exposures or respiratory illnesses were related to patterns of nasal cell gene expression.
The Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort included farm (n=156) and non-farm (n=155) families with children followed to age 2 years. Parents reported prenatal farm and other environmental exposures. Illness frequency and severity were assessed using illness diaries and periodic surveys. Nasopharyngeal cell gene expression in a subset of 64 children at age two years was compared to farm exposure and respiratory illness history.
Farm vs. non-farm children had nominally lower rates of respiratory illnesses (rate ratio 0.82 [0.69,0.97]) with a stepwise reduction in illness rates in children exposed to 0, 1, or ≥2 animal species, but these trends were non-significant in a multivariable model.

38308674,Reversible Elevation of Tryptase Over the Individual's Baseline: Why is It the Best Biomarker for Severe Systemic Mast Cell Activation and MCAS?,2024-02-03,"Mast cell (MC) activation syndromes (MCAS) are conditions defined by recurrent episodes of severe systemic anaphylaxis or similar systemic events triggered by MC-derived mediators that can be measured in biological fluids. Since some symptoms of MC activation may occur due to other, non-MC etiologies and lead to confusion over diagnosis, it is of crucial importance to document the involvement of MC and their products in the patients´ symptomatology.
The most specific and generally accepted marker of severe systemic MC activation is an event-related, transient increase in the serum tryptase level over the individual baseline of the affected individual. However, baseline concentrations of serum tryptase vary among donors, depending on the genetic background, age, kidney function, and underlying disease. As a result, it is of critical importance to provide a flexible equation that defines the diagnostic increase in tryptase qualifying as MCAS criterion in all patients, all situations, and all ranges of baseline serum tryptase. In 2012, the consensus group proposed the 120% + 2 ng/ml formula, which covers the great majority of groups, including cases with low, normal, or elevated basal serum tryptase level. This formula has been validated in subsequent studies and has proven to be a robust and consistent diagnostic criterion of MCAS. The present article is discussing the impact of this formula and possible limitations as well as alternative markers and mediators that may be indicative of MCAS.",,"[{'lastname': 'Valent', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.\nLudwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.'}, {'lastname': 'Akin', 'firstname': 'Cem', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Arock', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Platform of Molecular Analysis for Mastocytosis and MCAD (CEREMAST), Department of Biological Hematology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, AP-HP, Paris Sorbonne University, Paris, France.'}]"

We have shown an association between PAR-2 expression in peripheral blood monocytes and asthma severity as well as blood PAR-2 mRNA level and lung function. Since F2RL1 (the gene encoding PAR-2) polymorphisms affect PAR-2 expression, we hypothesize they may affect asthma severity.
We recruited 76 subjects with asthma of varying severity and collected clinical (FEV

However, bacterial infections related to AE in adults are poorly known. On the other hand, obese patients with asthma have their own clinical and biological characteristics compared with non-obese patients.
We investigated the differences in isolated pathogens for AE between obese and non-obese patients with asthma. We included 407 patients with AE from 24 medical centers in Korea. Microorganisms isolated from culture, RT-PCR or serologic tests using lower respiratory tract specimens were retrospectively investigated.
A total of 171 obese and 236 non-obese patients with asthma were included for analysis. Compared to non-obese patients, obese patients were associated with women (77.2% vs. 63.6%), never smoker (82.5% vs. 73.9%), shorter duration of asthma (7.9 ± 8.4 vs. 10.5 ± 10.1 years), less history of pulmonary tuberculosis (8.8% vs. 17.4%), and more comorbidity of allergic rhinitis (48.5% vs. 0.8%). Viral and/or bacterial infections were detected in 205 patients (50.4%) with AE. The numbers of patients with viral only, bacterial only, or both infections were 119, 49, and 37, respectively. The most commonly isolated bacterium was Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Obese patients showed a lower incidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection. In the non-obese group, bacterial infection, especially Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, was significantly associated with the duration of systemic corticosteroid use (13.6 ± 19.8 vs. 9.7 ± 6.7 days, p = 0.049).

Two researchers conducted comprehensive searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2022. Additionally, we investigated the FDA AE Reporting System for post-marketing adverse event (AE) reports related to anti-IL-5 drugs. The outcomes fulfilled the proportional reporting rate criteria and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network.
We included 24 published studies in our analysis. The anti-IL-5 treatment group showed an incidence of AEs comparable to the placebo group, and it exhibited a significantly lower frequency of serious AEs. Common AEs were asthma, nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and bronchitis. The post-marketing data included 28,478 case reports associated with the suspect drugs and 75 suspect safety observations affecting 16 system organ classes. New suspect observations included incomplete therapeutic product effect, URTIs, and pulmonary mass in reports related to mepolizumab. Reports associated with mepolizumab and benralizumab also indicated issues with incorrect technique in device usage and product issues.
Individual anti-IL-5 drugs' safety profiles largely matched their product inserts. We identified issues like improper device usage, product issue, and URTIs as potential concerns for mepolizumab and benralizumab.

Various statistical approaches based on penalized and machine learning methods have recently been proposed for disease prediction. In this study, we evaluated the performance of several such methods for predicting asthma using the Korean Chip (KORV1.1) from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES).
First, single-nucleotide polymorphisms were selected via single-variant tests using logistic regression with the adjustment of several epidemiological factors. Next, we evaluated the following methods for disease prediction: ridge, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, elastic net, smoothly clipped absolute deviation, support vector machine, random forest, boosting, bagging, naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor. Finally, we compared their predictive performance based on the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, balanced accuracy, error rate, Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under the precision-recall curve. Additionally, three oversampling algorithms are used to deal with imbalance problems.

In addition, the tobacco industry has a long and controversial history of trying to influence scientific research and of engaging in other morally problematic practices. In September 2021, the respiratory community was alarmed by the takeover of Vectura Group (Vectura) by Philip Morris International. As a reaction to this acquisition, strict measures were imposed by the International Respiratory Societies to prohibit the involvement of Vectura in respiratory research and its participation in societies' activities. International Respiratory Societies argued that Vectura had become part of the tobacco industry due to this takeover and is, therefore, subject to the same rules and restrictions. From a healthcare and historical perspective, the reaction and imposed measures are very understandable. However, for researchers that were already affiliated with Vectura through long-standing agreements and for research that was funded by Vectura, the imposed measures have serious consequences. With this article, we provide an example of these consequences. By reflecting on this issue, we would like to start a conversation regarding the current measures and to encourage the respiratory community to begin thinking of a way to avoid these consequences in the future.

However, it remains unclear whether stress-related chronic conditions associated with ACEs, such as asthma, increase the long-term mental health burden of ACEs.
To investigate the joint association of ACEs and asthma with subsequent depressive symptoms among US adults.
This study used data from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System 2010, including 21 544 participants over 18 years old from four states where participants were questioned about ACEs. We used logistic regression models to calculate the adjusted OR (aOR) for elevated depressive symptoms evaluated by Patient Health Questionnaire-8 according to ACEs and asthma, along with marginal structural models (MSM) to consider ACE-related confounders between asthma and depression. We evaluated the additive interaction between ACEs and asthma on depressive symptoms with the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).
Of the 21 544 participants (mean age: 56, women: 59.5%), 52.3% reported ≥1 ACEs, 14.9% reported a history of asthma and 4.0% had depressive symptoms. ACEs and asthma were independently associated with elevated depressive symptoms (aORs (95% CI) were 2.85 (2.30 to 3.55) and 2.24 (1.50 to 3.27), respectively). Furthermore, our MSM revealed an additive interaction between ACEs and asthma for depressive symptoms (RERI (95% CI)=+1.63 (0.54 to 2.71)).
These findings suggest that asthma amplifies the risk of depressive symptoms associated with ACEs.

A matched population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Ontario including patients aged 18-50 years with a first-time endometriosis diagnosis between January 1, 2010, and July 1, 2020. Endometriosis exposure was determined through either medical or surgical diagnostic criteria. A medical diagnosis was defined by the International Classification of Disease diagnostic codes from outpatient and in-hospital visits, while a surgical diagnosis was identified through inpatient or same-day surgeries. Individuals with endometriosis were matched 1:2 on age, sex, and geography to unexposed individuals without a history of endometriosis. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of any mental health condition after endometriosis diagnosis. Individuals with a mental health diagnosis in the two years before study entry were excluded. Cox regression models generated hazard ratios (aHR) adjusted for hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, infertility, pregnancy history, qualifying surgery for study inclusion, immigration status, history of asthma, abnormal uterine bleeding, diabetes, fibroids, hypertension, irritable bowel disorder, migraines, and nulliparity.
A total of 107,832 individuals were included, 35,944 with a diagnosis of endometriosis (29.5% medically, 60.5% surgically, 10.0% medically with surgical confirmation) and 71,888 unexposed individuals. Over the study period, the incidence rate was 105.3 mental health events per 1,000 person-years in the endometriosis group compared to 66.5 mental health events per 1,000 person-year for unexposed individuals. Relative to the unexposed, the aHR for a mental health diagnosis was 1.28 (95% CI 1.24 - 1.33) in patients with medically diagnosed endometriosis, 1.33 (95% CI 1.16 - 1.52) in surgically diagnosed patients, and 1.36 (95% CI 1.2 - 1.6) in those diagnosed medically then confirmed surgically. The risk of receiving a mental health diagnosis was highest in the first year after endometriosis diagnosis and declined in subsequent years. The cumulative incidence of a severe mental health condition requiring hospital visits was 7.0% in endometriosis patients compared to 4.6% for unexposed individuals (HR 1.56, 95%CI 1.53-1.59).
Endometriosis, regardless of mode of diagnosis, is associated with a marginally increased risk of mental health conditions. The elevated risk, particularly evident in the years immediately following the diagnosis, underscores the need for proactive mental health screening for those newly diagnosed with endometriosis. Future research should investigate the potential benefits of mental health interventions for people with endometriosis, aiming to enhance their overall quality of life.",,"[{'lastname': 'Thiel', 'firstname': 'Peter S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bougie', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Queen's University, Kingston Health Sciences Center, Kingston, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Pudwell', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Queen's University, Kingston Health Sciences Center, Kingston, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Shellenberger', 'firstname': 'Jonas', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada; Health Services and Policy Research Institute, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Velez', 'firstname': 'Maria P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Queen's University, Kingston Health Sciences Center, Kingston, ON, Canada; ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Murji', 'firstname': 'Ally', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

38307385,Lactoylglutathione promotes inflammatory signaling in macrophages through histone lactoylation.,2024-02-03,"Chronic, systemic inflammation is a pathophysiological manifestation of metabolic disorders. Inflammatory signaling leads to elevated glycolytic flux and a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis and lactate generation. This rise in lactate corresponds with increased generation of lactoylLys modifications on histones, mediating transcriptional responses to inflammatory stimuli. Lactoylation is also generated through a non-enzymatic S-to-N acyltransfer from the glyoxalase cycle intermediate, lactoylglutathione (LGSH). Here, we report a regulatory role for LGSH in mediating histone lactoylation and inflammatory signaling. In the absence of the primary LGSH hydrolase, glyoxalase 2 (GLO2), RAW264.7 macrophages display significant elevations in LGSH and histone lactoylation with a corresponding potentiation of the inflammatory response when exposed to lipopolysaccharides. An analysis of chromatin accessibility shows that lactoylation is associated with more compacted chromatin than acetylation in an unstimulated state; upon stimulation, however, regions of the genome associated with lactoylation become markedly more accessible. Lastly, we demonstrate a spontaneous S-to-S acyltransfer of lactate from LGSH to CoA, yielding lactoyl-CoA. This represents the first known mechanism for the generation of this metabolite. Collectively, these data suggest that LGSH, and not intracellular lactate, is the primary driving factor facilitating histone lactoylation and a major contributor to inflammatory signaling.",,"[{'lastname': 'Trujillo', 'firstname': 'Marissa N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jennings', 'firstname': 'Erin Q', 'initials': 'EQ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoffman', 'firstname': 'Emely A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Phoebe', 'firstname': 'Aiden M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mastin', 'firstname': 'Grace E', 'initials': 'GE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kitamura', 'firstname': 'Naoya', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Reisz', 'firstname': 'Julie A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Megill', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kantner', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Marcinkiewicz', 'firstname': 'Mariola M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Twardy', 'firstname': 'Shannon M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lebario', 'firstname': 'Felicidad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chapman', 'firstname': 'Eli', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McCullough', 'firstname': 'Rebecca L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Alessandro"", 'firstname': 'Angelo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Snyder', 'firstname': 'Nathaniel W', 'initials': 'NW', 'affiliation': 'Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cusanovich', 'firstname': 'Darren A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Galligan', 'firstname': 'James J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.

38307356,Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics to reveal the mechanism of Gerberae piloselloidis herba in alleviating bronchial asthma.,2024-02-03,"Gerberae Piloselloides Herba (GPH) is derived from Gerbera piloselloides (Linn.) Cass. It is a commonly used traditional medicine in China, featured by its special bioactivities as antitussive, expectorant, anti-asthma, anti-bacterial and anti-tumor. It is often used as an effective treatment for cough and sore throat as well as bronchial asthma (BA) in China. It was demonstrated in our previous studies that GPH exerted significant effects on the treatment of BA, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear.
This study was aimed at revealing the mechanism through which GPH protects against BA.
The protective effect of GPH against BA was evaluated in a mouse model of BA induced by ovalbumin. Through integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis, the most critical pathways were discovered. The effects of GPH in regulating these pathways was verified through molecular biology experiments and molecular docking.
GPH have anti-BA effects. In plasma and lung tissue, 5 and 17 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), respectively, showed a reversed tendency in the GPH group compared with the model group; apart from gamma-aminobutyric acid and butyrylcarnitine, these DEMs might aid in BA diagnosis. The DEMs were involved primarily in the regulation of lipid metabolism, followed by glucose metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that GPH modulated 268 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Integration analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics revealed that GPH might regulate the PPAR signaling pathway, thus affecting the expression of key gene targets such as Cyp4a12a, Cyp4a12b, Adh7, Acaa1b and Gpat2; controlling fatty acid degradation, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism and other lipid metabolic pathways; and ameliorating BA. This possibility was confirmed through reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunofluorescence and molecular docking.
GPH was found to activate the PPAR signaling pathway, decrease the levels of Cyp4a12a and Cyp4a12b, and increase the levels of Adh7, Acaa1b and Gpat2, thereby regulating lipid metabolism disorder, decreasing the generation of inflammatory mediators and limiting lung injury.","GPH was found to activate the PPAR signaling pathway, decrease the levels of Cyp4a12a and Cyp4a12b, and increase the levels of Adh7, Acaa1b and Gpat2, thereby regulating lipid metabolism disorder, decreasing the generation of inflammatory mediators and limiting lung injury.","[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chunhua', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Changli', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China; School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Jia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Ting', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yonglin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Aimin', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, China.

38307355,Protective effects of an alcoholic extract of Kaempferia galanga L. rhizome on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in mice.,2024-02-03,"The rhizome of Kaempferia galanga L., a medicinal and edible Plant, was widely distributed in many Asian and African counties. It has been traditionally used to treat gastroenteritis, hypertension, rheumatism and asthma. However, there is a lack of modern pharmacology studies regarding its anti-gastric ulcer activity.
The objective of this study is to investigate the protective effects of an extract from K. galanga L. rhizome (Kge) and its active components kaempferol and luteolin on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer.
The kge was prepared by ultrasonic-assisted extraction, and the contents of kaempferol and luteolin were determined by HPLC. The mice were randomly divided into seven groups: blank control (0.5 % CMC-Na; 0.1 mL/10 g), untreatment (0.5 % CMC-Na; 0.1 mL/10 g), Kge (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), kaempferol (100 mg/kg) and luteolin (100 mg/kg) groups. The mice were treated intragastrically once daily for 7 days. At 1 h post the last administration, the mice in all groups except the blank control group were intragastrically administrated with anhydrous alcohol (0.1 mL/10 g) once to induce gastric ulcer. Then, fasting was continued for 1 h, followed by sample collection for evaluation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay.
The contents of kaempferol and luteolin in Kge were determined as 3713 μg/g and 2510 μg/g, respectively. Alcohol induced severely damages with edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and bleeding, and the ulcer index was 17.63 %. After pre-treatment with Kge (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), kaempferol and luteolin, the pathological lesions were obviously alleviated and ulcer indices were reduced to 13.42 %, 11.65 %, 6.54 %, 3.58 % and 3.85 %, respectively. In untreated group, the contents of Ca

38307258,Effect of plasma exosome lncRNA on isoproterenol hydrochloride-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.,2024-02-03,"Isoprenaline hydrochloride (IH) is a β-adrenergic receptor agonist commonly used in the treatment of hypotension, shock, asthma, and other diseases. However, IH-induced cardiotoxicity limits its application. A large number of studies have shown that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulates the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether abnormal lncRNA expression is involved in IH-mediated cardiotoxicity. First, the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat myocardial injury model was established. Circulating exosomes were extracted from the plasma of rats and identified. In total, 108 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 150 DE mRNAs were identified by sequencing. These results indicate that these lncRNAs and mRNAs are substantially involved in chemical cardiotoxicity. Further signaling pathway and functional studies indicated that lncRNAs and mRNAs regulate several biological processes, such as selective mRNA splicing through spliceosomes, participate in sphingolipid metabolic pathways, and play a certain role in the circulatory system. Finally, we obtained 3 upregulated lncRNAs through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) verification and selected target lncRNA-mRNA pairs according to the regulatory relationship of lncRNA/mRNA, some of which were associated with myocardial injury.

The efficacy and safety of SQ sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablets have been confirmed across large clinical trials in adults with grass, tree, ragweed, and house dust mite (HDM) AR/C.
This pooled analysis investigates whether the reduction in symptom burden found across the clinical trials is supported by improvements in QoL.
11 phase II/III randomized placebo-controlled trials across the SQ grass, tree, ragweed and HDM SLIT-tablets (Grass: N=3179; Ragweed: N=767; Tree: N=634; HDM: N=2221) were included. QoL was assessed using the standardized Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) with the exception of three grass trials that used the non-standardized version. The overall RQLQ scores were expressed as a mean of seven domains. In the pooled analysis, treatment was used as fixed effect; the trial, and the interaction between region/country with the trial as random effects.
The pooled analysis showed consistent and statistically significant improvements in overall RQLQ scores across all four SQ SLIT-tablets vs. placebo (Pooled estimate [95%CI], p value. Grass: -0.20 [-0.28, -0.12], P<0.001. Tree: -0.42 [-0.58, -0.26], P<0.001. Ragweed: -0.36 [-0.55, -0.17], P<0.001. HDM: -0.28 [-0.39, -0.17], P<0.001). Furthermore, significant improvements vs. placebo for all four SQ SLIT-tablets were seen across the 7 individual domains.

38306564,Association of asthma and lung cancer risk: A pool of cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analysis.,2024-02-02,"Over the past 2 decades, population-based studies have shown an increased association between asthma and the risk of lung cancer. However, the causal links between these 2 conditions remain poorly understood.
We conducted a comprehensive search of various databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, up until May 04, 2023. Only articles published in English were included in our study. We performed a meta-analysis using random-effects models to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on study design, gender, and histologic types. We also conducted a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using the genome-wide association study pooled data (408,422 people) published by the UK Biobank to explore further the potential causal relationship between asthma and lung cancer.
Our meta-analysis reviewed 24 population-based cohort studies involving 1072,502 patients, revealing that asthma is significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.38) in all individuals. Subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher risk of lung cancer in females with asthma (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.49). We found no significant association between asthma and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.54-1.05), lung squamous carcinomas (LUSC) (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.79-1.50), or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.68-1.49). Interestingly, our MR analysis supported an increasing causality between asthma and lung cancer (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.17, P = .0008), specifically in those who ever smoker (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.16, P = .0173) and LUSC pathological type (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26, P = .0038).
Through meta-analysis, our study confirms that patients with asthma have a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Our MR study further support an increasing causal relationship between asthma and the risk of lung cancer, particularly in smokers and LUSC. Future studies examining the link between asthma and the risk of developing lung cancer should consider the bias of controlled and uncontrolled asthma.","Through meta-analysis, our study confirms that patients with asthma have a higher risk of developing lung cancer.

We aimed to develop an algorithm that could accurately predict high pollen days to underpin an alert system that would allow patients to take timely precautionary measures. We developed and validated two prediction models that take historical pollen and weather data as their input to predict the start date and peak date of the pollen season in Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan. The first model is based on linear regression and the second one is based on phenological modelling. We tested our models on an original and comprehensive dataset from Islamabad. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) for the start day are 2.3 and 3.7 days for the linear and phenological models, respectively, while for the peak day, the MAEs are 3.3 and 4.0 days, respectively. These encouraging results could be used in a website or app to notify patients and healthcare providers to start preparing for the paper mulberry pollen season.

This study aimed to investigate the associations of sociodemographic factors, health behavior, and parental or workplace smoking with adult asthma risk in the United States (US).
A secondary data analysis on 874 participants aged 25-45 was performed using data from the 2011-2014 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States Refresher. Participants were divided into smokers and nonsmokers. Participants were further divided into groups A (a father or mother with a smoking history) and B (others in the house or colleagues in the workplace who had a smoking history).
Findings from the FREQ procedure revealed that sociodemographic (female, black, school or college education, unmarried/divorced, and employed) and lifestyle (no alcohol intake, physically inactive, and obese) and clinical (diabetes and joint disease) factors were significantly associated with one- or more-fold odds of asthma among adult smokers than nonsmokers. Adult smokers in group A, particularly females, those with a high school or college education, physically inactive, and overweight or obese, had a higher risk of asthma than those in group B.
Adult smokers' risk of developing asthma is increased in the US by having smoked with their parents, being a woman, being black, having a school or college education, being single or divorced, working, not drinking alcohol, being physically inactive, being obese, having diabetes, and having a joint disease.","Adult smokers' risk of developing asthma is increased in the US by having smoked with their parents, being a woman, being black, having a school or college education, being single or divorced, working, not drinking alcohol, being physically inactive, being obese, having diabetes, and having a joint disease.","[{'lastname': 'Alwadeai', 'firstname': 'Khalid S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

This study aims to explore the therapeutic potential of RDN in asthma and the underlying mechanisms. A mouse model of asthma was established by the stimulation of ovalbumin (OVA). HE staining was performed to detect the pathological injuries of tracheal tissues. The protein expression of collagen I, FN1, α-SMA (airway remodeling markers), and p-p38 (a marker of the p38 MAPK pathway) were detected by Western blot. Eosinophils were then isolated from the model mice. Cell viability and ROS level were measured by CCK-8 and Flow cytometry, respectively. The mRNA expression of GPX4 and ACSL4 (ferroptosis markers) in eosinophils were measured by qRT-PCR. RDN significantly reduced the numbers of total cells and eosnophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, and down-regulated remodeling markers (Collagen I, FN1, and α-SMA) in OVA-induced mice. The p38 MAPK pathway was blocked by the intervention of RDN in the model mice, and its blocking weakens the poor manifestations of OVA-induced asthma. In addition, RDN induced the ferroptosis of eosnophils both in vitro and in vivo. Blocking of the p38 MAPK pathway also enhanced the ferroptosis of eosnophils in vitro, evidenced by the decreased cell viability and GPX4 expression, and increased ROS level and ACSL4 expression.

38304673,Predictive Factors of Hospitalization and Emergency Visits Among Children With Asthma.,2024-02-02,"Introduction A chronic diverse inflammatory disease, asthma affects millions of people worldwide. To control asthma, standardized care is essential. Children with asthma who receive appropriate care have lower emergency room (ER) visits and hospital stays as well as a higher quality of life than children who do not receive appropriate care. We aim to evaluate the predictive variables of hospitalization and ER visits in children with asthma. Methodology In 2022 and 2023, a cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on children with asthma and their caregivers who were attending primary health care clinics in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. We used the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) to evaluate asthma control. A C-ACT score of less than 19 indicates uncontrolled childhood asthma. To investigate the relationships between the risk factors and the rate of ER visits and hospitalizations, we performed a multiple logistic descriptive analysis. Results In this study, 124 asthmatic children from primary health care centers matched the inclusion criteria. The majority of children had atopy, and their mean age was 10.8±3.4 years. Concerning the risk factors linked to ER visits and hospitalization, there is evidence that not following up with physicians, using more frequent and short-acting beta-agonists, exposure to smoke and household pets, and poor asthma control are linked to increased rates of both ER visits and hospitalizations. Conclusion Better asthma control in children and adolescents may be achieved by providing inexpensive asthma care services, more thorough parental and child education, and effective symptom management. These measures can help reduce exacerbations of asthma and the consequences that accompany them.",,"[{'lastname': 'Al Ghadeer', 'firstname': 'Hussain A', 'initials': 'HA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Aldandan', 'firstname': 'Jalal K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alessa', 'firstname': 'Marwah A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Al Ali', 'firstname': 'Sirar A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, New Medical Center (NMC) Royal Hospital, Sharjah, ARE.'}, {'lastname': 'Alajalin', 'firstname': 'Abdullah M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Prince Saud Bin Jalawi Hospital, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Al Ghadeer', 'firstname': 'Ali A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Dentistry, Vision College, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Albahrani', 'firstname': 'Hassan M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alherz', 'firstname': 'Qasem I', 'initials': 'QI', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Almulhim', 'firstname': 'Latifah A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Altaweel', 'firstname': 'Ibrahim A', 'initials': 'IA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alqahtani', 'firstname': 'Badah A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Al Bensaad', 'firstname': 'Ghadeer A', 'initials': 'GA', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alnasser', 'firstname': 'Muntaha N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alhumaid', 'firstname': 'Rawan H', 'initials': 'RH', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Fatani', 'firstname': 'Reham M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.'}]"

38304143,Exposure to household secondhand tobacco smoke and the odds of developing atopic dermatitis among adolescents: A causal mediation analysis.,2024-02-02,"Exposure to household secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) among adolescents has been shown to be associated with atopic dermatitis, and affects disproportionality females. However, the mechanisms underlying this link are uncertain. This study sought to identify modifiable factors that mediate the relationship between household SHS exposure and atopic dermatitis among adolescents.
During October 2015, a cross-sectional study was conducted using the ISAAC questionnaire for data collection from adolescents enrolled in nine high schools of Hawalli - one of the six governorates of Kuwait. Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported tobacco smoking among adolescents, household SHS exposure (≥1 smokers at home vs none), self-reported asthma and atopic dermatitis. For causal mediation analysis an inverse odds-weighting approach was used.
Of 746 participants, 74.8% were Kuwaiti, 50.1% were female, 12.4% were regular daily smokers and 54.1% had household SHS exposure, which was more common among Kuwaiti (79.6%) than non-Kuwaiti (20.4%) adolescents. The prevalences of self-reported asthma and atopic dermatitis were 20.6% and 14.9%, respectively. After adjusting for the pre-exposure covariates (i.e. sex and nativity), household SHS exposure had a significant (p=0.043) total effect, non-significant (p=0.133) natural direct effect, and marginally insignificant (p=0.058) natural indirect effect, which were jointly mediated by asthma status and adolescent's self-reported smoking status, with a proportion of mediated risk to atopic dermatitis of 29.6%.
Asthma and self-tobacco smoking among adolescents not only directly affected but also mediated household SHS exposure effect on atopic dermatitis risk. Voluntarily adopting a smoke-free home rule may minimize household SHS exposure, reduce the odds of developing asthma, and deter the initiation of tobacco smoking among adolescents.

38303079,Abrogation and homeostatic restoration of IgE responses by a universal IgE allergy CTL vaccine-The three signal self/non-self/self (S/NS/S) theory.,2024-02-02,"Natural IgE cytotoxic peptides (nECPs), which are derived from the constant domain of the heavy chain of human IgE producing B cells via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, are decorated onto MHC class 1a molecules (MHCIa) as unique biomarkers for CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte)-mediated immune surveillance. Human IgE exhibits only one isotype and lacks polymorphisms; IgE is pivotal in mediating diverse, allergen-specific allergies. Therefore, by disrupting self-IgE tolerance via costimulation, the CTLs induced by nECPs can serve as universal allergy vaccines (UAVs) in humans to dampen IgE production mediated by diverse allergen-specific IgE-secreting B cells and plasma cells expressing surface nECP-MHCIa as targets. The study herein has enabled the identification of nECPs, A32 and SP-1/SP-2 nonameric natural peptides produced through the correspondence principle. Vaccination using nECP induced nECP-specific CTL that profoundly suppressed human IgE production in vitro as well as chimeric human IgE production in human IgE/HLA-A2.01/HLA-B7.02 triple transgenic rodents. Furthermore, nECP-tetramer-specific CTLs were found to be converted into CD4 Tregs that restored IgE competence via the homeostatic principle, mediatepred by SREBP-1c suppressed DCs. Thus, nECPs showed causal efficacy and safety as UAVs for treating categorically type I hypersensitivity IgE-mediated allergies. The applied vaccination concept presented provides the foundation to unify, integrate through a singular class of tetramer-specific TCR clonotypes for regulaing human IgE production. The three signal theory pertains to mechanisms of three cells underlying central tolerance (S), breaking self tolerance (NS) and regaining peripheral tolerance (S) via homeostasis concerning nECP as an efficacious and safe UAV to treat type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.

38302925,Upregulated microRNA-125b-5p in patients with asthma-COPD overlap mediates oxidative stress and late apoptosis via targeting IL6R/TRIAP1 signaling.,2024-02-02,"Among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), some have features of both asthma and COPD-a condition categorized as asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). Our aim was to determine whether asthma- or COPD-related microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in the pathogenesis of ACO.
A total of 22 healthy subjects and 27 patients with ACO were enrolled. We selected 6 miRNAs that were found to correlate with COPD and asthma. The expression of miRNAs and target genes was analyzed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Cell apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species production were evaluated using flow cytometry. In vitro human monocytic THP-1 cells and primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells under stimuli with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or ovalbumin (OVA) allergen or both were used to verify the clinical findings.
We identified the upregulation of miR-125b-5p in patients with ACO and in THP-1 cells stimulated with CSE plus OVA allergen. We selected 16 genes related to the miR-125b-5p pathway and found that IL6R and TRIAP1 were both downregulated in patients with ACO and in THP-1 cells stimulated with CSE plus OVA. The percentage of late apoptotic cells increased in the THP-1 cell culture model when stimulated with CSE plus OVA, and the effect was reversed by transfection with miR-125b-5p small interfering RNA (siRNA). The percentage of reactive oxygen species-producing cells increased in the NHBE cell culture model when stimulated with CSE plus OVA, and the effect was reversed by transfection with miR-125b-5p siRNA. In NHBE cells, siRNA transfection reversed the upregulation of STAT3 under CSE+OVA stimulation.
Our study revealed that upregulation of miR-125b-5p in patients with ACO mediated late apoptosis in THP-1 cells and oxidative stress in NHBE cells via targeting IL6R and TRIAP1.

38302919,"40 years of adding more fructose to high fructose corn syrup than is safe, through the lens of malabsorption and altered gut health-gateways to chronic disease.",2024-02-02,"Labels do not disclose the excess-free-fructose/unpaired-fructose content in foods/beverages. Objective was to estimate excess-free-fructose intake using USDA loss-adjusted-food-availability (LAFA) data (1970-2019) for high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and apple juice, major sources of excess-free-fructose, for comparison with malabsorption dosages (~ 5 g-children/ ~ 10 g-adults). Unlike sucrose and equimolar fructose/glucose, unpaired-fructose triggers fructose malabsorption and its health consequences. Daily intakes were calculated for HFCS that is generally-recognized-as-safe/ (55% fructose/45% glucose), and variants (65/35, 60/40) with higher fructose-to-glucose ratios (1.9:1, 1.5:1), as measured by independent laboratories. Estimations include consumer-level-loss (CLL) allowances used before (20%), and after, subjective, retroactively-applied increases (34%), as recommended by corn-refiners (~ 2012). No contributions from crystalline-fructose or agave syrup were included due to lack of LAFA data. High-excess-free-fructose-fruits (apples/pears/watermelons/mangoes) were not included. Eaten in moderation they are less likely to trigger malabsorption. Another objective was to identify potential parallel trends between excess-free-fructose intake and the ""unexplained"" US asthma epidemic. The fructose/gut-dysbiosis/lung axis is well documented, case-study evidence and epidemiological research link HFCS/apple juice intake with asthma, and unlike gut-dysbiosis/gut-fructosylation, childhood asthma prevalence data spans > 40 years. Results Excess-free-fructose daily intake for individuals consuming HFCS with an average 1.5:1 fructose-to-glucose ratio, ranged from 0.10 g/d in 1970, to 11.3 g/d in 1999, to 6.5 g/d in 2019, and for those consuming HFCS with an average 1.9:1 ratio, intakes ranged from 0.13 g/d to 16.9 g/d (1999), to 9.7 g/d in 2019, based upon estimates with a 20% CLL allowance. Intake exceeded dosages that trigger malabsorption (~ 5 g) around ~ 1980. By the early 1980's, tripled apple juice intake had added ~ 0.5 g to average-per-capita excess-free-fructose intake. Contributions were higher (~ 3.8 g /4-oz.) for individuals consuming apple juice consistent with a healthy eating pattern (4-oz. children, 8-oz. adults). The ""unexplained"" childhood asthma epidemic (1980-present) parallels increasing average-per-capita HFCS/apple juice intake trends and reflects epidemiological research findings. Conclusion Displacement of sucrose with HFCS, its ubiquitous presence in the US food-supply, the industry practice of adding more fructose to HFCS than generally-recognized-as-safe, and increased use of apple juice/crystalline fructose/agave syrup in foods/beverages has contributed to unprecedented excess-free-fructose intake levels, fructose malabsorption, gut-dysbiosis and gut-fructosylation (immunogen burden)-gateways to chronic disease.",,"[{'lastname': 'DeChristopher', 'firstname': 'Luanne Robalo', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': ', East Fishkill, USA. luanne.dechristopher@gmail.com.'}]"

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed evaluating the respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function, post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A systematic search was performed in databases up to 30 March 2023. Studies evaluating respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function after COVID-19 infection in children were selected. The major outcomes were the frequency of respiratory symptoms and the mean of spirometry parameters. A pooled mean with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated.
A total of 8 articles with 386 patients were included in meta-analysis. Dyspnea, cough, exercise intolerance, and fatigue were the most common symptoms. The meta-mean of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was 101.72%, 95% CI= (98.72, 104.73) and 101.31%, 95% CI= (95.44, 107.18) respectively.

38302750,Neurological and immunological adverse events after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children using national immunization programme registry data.,2024-02-02,"Despite the general consensus on the safety of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), safety concerns unveiled during post-licensure surveillance need to be addressed. We investigated whether there is a transient increased risk following a three-dose series of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.
This was a population-based cohort study using the Korea immunization registry data linked to nationwide administrative claims data. Self-controlled risk interval analysis was conducted for PCV recipients who had an outcome of interest within pre-defined risk and control intervals between 2018 and 2022. The outcomes were anaphylaxis, asthma, encephalopathy, febrile seizure, Kawasaki disease and thrombocytopenia. We used conditional Poisson regression model to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the outcomes in the risk and control intervals.
Of 1 114 096 PCV recipients, 8661 had outcomes either in the risk or control intervals. Their mean age at Dose 1 was 10.0 weeks, 58.3% were boys, and 85.3% received 13-valent PCV. PCV was not associated with an increased risk of any outcomes except for febrile seizure. There were 408 (56.0%) cases of febrile seizure in the risk interval, corresponding to an IRR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.10-1.47).
It is reassuring to note that there was no increased risk of the potential safety concerns following PCV administration. Despite the transient increased risk of febrile seizure, absolute numbers of cases were small. Febrile seizure is generally self-limiting with a good prognosis, and should not discourage parents or caregivers from vaccinating their children.",,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ju Hwan', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.\nDepartment of Biohealth Regulatory Science, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoon', 'firstname': 'Dongwon', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.\nDepartment of Biohealth Regulatory Science, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Hyesung', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.\nDepartment of Biohealth Regulatory Science, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choe', 'firstname': 'Young June', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Ju-Young', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.\nDepartment of Biohealth Regulatory Science, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.\nDepartment of Clinical Research Design & Evaluation, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences & Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea.'}]"
38302598,Amlexanox attenuates LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses in microglial cells via inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways.,2024-02-02,"Amlexanox is an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic agent used clinically for the treatment of aphthous ulcers, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Recent studies have demonstrated that amlexanox, a selective inhibitor of IkB kinase epsilon (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), suppresses a range of diseases or inflammatory conditions, such as obesity-related metabolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. However, the effects of amlexanox on neuroinflammatory responses to amlexanox have not yet been comprehensively studied. In this study, we investigated the novel therapeutic effect of amlexanox on LPS-induced neuroinflammation in vivo, and intraperitoneal injection of amlexanox markedly reduced LPS-induced IKKε levels, proinflammatory cytokines, and microglial activation, as evidenced by ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) immunostaining. Furthermore, amlexanox significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in LPS-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), murine BV2, and human HMC3 microglial cells. This data provided considerable evidence that amlexanox can be used as a preventive and curative therapy for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. In terms of mechanism aspects, our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory action of amlexanox in BV2 microglial cells was through the downregulation of NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways. In addition, the combination of amlexanox and SPI (a STAT3 selective inhibitor) showed high efficiency in inhibiting the production of neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory mediators.

Our study aimed to investigate the withanolides with anti-hepatic fibrosis effect from P. angulate.
Withanolides were obtained from the EtOH extract of P. angulate by bioassay-molecular networking analysis-guided isolation using column chromatography and normal/reversed-phase semipreparative HPLC. The structures of new withanolides were elucidated by combinations of spectroscopic techniques with NMR and ECD calculations. MTT cell viability assay, AO/EB staining method, cell wound healing assay, ELISA and Western blot experiments were employed to evaluate the anti-hepatic fibrosis activity and to uncover related mechanism. Molecular docking analysis and cellular thermal shift assay were used to evaluate and verify the interaction between the active withanolides and their potential targets.
Eight unreported withanolides, withagulides A-H (1-8), along with twenty-eight known ones were obtained from P. angulate. Withanolides 6, 9, 10, 24, 27, and 29-32 showed marked anti-hepatic fibrosis effect with COL1A1 expression inhibition above 50 %.

38301981,"Fraxini cortex: Progresses in phytochemistry, pharmacology and ethnomedicinal uses.",2024-02-02,"Fraxini cortex, which has been widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine for 2000 years, is made from the dried bark of four plant species: Fraxinus chinensis subsp. rhynchophylla (Hance) A.E.Murray, Fraxinus chinensis Roxb., Fraxinus chinensis subsp. chinensis and Fraxinus stylosa Lingelsh.. In Chinese traditional medicine, it possesses the properties of heat-clearing and dampness-drying, asthma relief and cough suppression, as well as vision improvement. It is utilized for treating bacterial disorders, enteritis, leukorrhea, chronic bronitis, painful red eyes with swelling, lacrimation due to windward exposure, psoriasis, and other diseases or related symptoms.
Fraxini cortex is abundant in chemical constituents and has garnered significant attention from plant chemists, particularly regarding coumarins, as evidenced by the recently identified three coumarin compounds. Considering the current dearth of systematic reporting on studies pertaining to Fraxini cortex, herein we provide a comprehensive summary of the advancements in phytochemistry, pharmacology, detection methods, and ethnomedicinal applications of Fraxini cortex.
We conducted a comprehensive search across online data sources (Web of Science, Public Medicine (PubMed), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), as well as Chinese dissertations) and traditional Chinese medicine classics to gather the necessary literature resources for this review.
Briefly, The Fraxini cortex yielded a total of 132 phytochemicals, including coumarins, lignans, secoiridoids, phenylethanol glycosides, flavonoids, triterpenoids, and other compounds. Among them, the main active ingredients are coumarins which possess a diverse range of pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory effects, anti-tumor properties, prevention of tissue fibrosis and oxidation damage as well as cardioprotective effects.
All types of research conducted on Fraxini cortex, particularly in the field of ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacology, have been thoroughly reviewed. However, certain traditional applications and pharmacological activities of Fraxini cortex lack scientific evaluation or convincing evidence due to incomplete methodologies and ambiguous results, as well as a lack of clinical data. To validate its pharmacological activity, clinical efficacy, and safety profile, a systematic and comprehensive research evaluation is imperative. As an important traditional Chinese medicine, Fraxini cortex should be further explored to facilitate the development of novel drugs and therapeutics for various diseases. Greater attention should be given to how it can be better utilized.",,"[{'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Zuoliang', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Science, Jiaying University, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Conservation and Precision Utilization of Characteristic Agricultural Resources in Mountainous Areas, China.

We investigated the role of residential surrounding greenness on the risk of incident asthma using a population-based retrospective cohort study. We included 982,131 singleton births in Ontario, Canada between 2006 and 2013. Two measures of greenness, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Green View Index (GVI), were assigned to the residential histories of these infants from pregnancy through to 12 years of age. Longitudinally-based diagnoses of asthma were determined by using provincial administrative health data. The extended Cox hazards model was used to characterize associations between greenness measures and asthma (up to age 12 years) while adjusting for several risk factors.

38299973,All shook up: how the COVID-19 pandemic rocked pediatric asthma care.,2024-02-01,"Asthma management is a crucial aspect of public health. The landscape of asthma management underwent significant change in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. These changes greatly affected existing patients, individuals suffering with undiagnosed illness, providers, and the healthcare system as a whole.
Providers had to navigate through the potential risk of exposure while weighing the benefit of office visits for patients. This promoted the rapid uptake of telemedicine and virtual outreach, as well as modifications to acute management and controller therapies. Telehealth allowed for the remote monitoring of these patient populations, increased compliance with home-based self-management, and an emphasis on patient education. Furthermore, the pandemic underscored the importance of proactive asthma management as many individuals were left untreated or undiagnosed for various reasons. It is evident that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reshaped the landscape of various components of the healthcare system, including asthma management, necessitating innovative approaches to monitoring and patient education.

38299780,Exploring the perceptions of patients with chronic respiratory diseases and their insights into pulmonary rehabilitation in Bangladesh.,2024-02-01,"Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) require holistic management which considers patients' preferences, appropriate pharmacotherapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and integrated care. We aimed to understand the perceptions of people with CRDs about their condition and pulmonary rehabilitation in Bangladesh.
We conducted semi-structured interviews with a maximum variation sample of people with CRDs who had participated in a feasibility study of pulmonary rehabilitation in 2021/2022. A multidisciplinary team transcribed the interviews verbatim and analysed them in Bengali using a grounded theory approach.
We interviewed 15 participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or post-tuberculosis. The analysis revealed three themes. The first encompassed understanding CRDs: Patients characterised their condition by the symptoms (e.g. 'Hapani' meaning 'breathlessness') rather than describing a disease entity. Some believed occupation, previous infection, or family history to be a cause. The second theme included perceptions of pulmonary rehabilitation: Exercise was counterintuitive, as it exacerbated the breathlessness symptom that defined their disease. Views varied, though many acknowledged the benefits after a few sessions. Even with home-based programmes, participants described practical barriers to finding time for the sessions and adopted strategies to overcome the challenges. The third theme focused on implementation: Participants highlighted the need for raising awareness of CRDs and the potential of pulmonary rehabilitation in the community, adapting to the local context, and establishing an accessible resourced service.
Understanding how patients and their communities perceive their condition and the barriers (both conceptual and logistical) to acceptance is the first step to embedding this highly effective intervention into routine health care services in Bangladesh with potential benefits for the increasing number of people living with CRDs in low- and middle-income countries.",,"[{'lastname': 'Habib', 'firstname': 'G M Monsur', 'initials': 'GMM', 'affiliation': 'Community Respiratory Centre, Khulna, Bangladesh Primary Care Respiratory Society (BPCRS), Bangladesh.\nNIHR Global Health Research Unit on Respiratory Health (RESPIRE), Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Uzzaman', 'firstname': 'Nazim', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Community Respiratory Centre, Khulna, Bangladesh Primary Care Respiratory Society (BPCRS), Bangladesh.\nNIHR Global Health Research Unit on Respiratory Health (RESPIRE), Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rabinovich', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""ELEGI/Colt laboratory, Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute (QMRI), University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Akhter', 'firstname': 'Sumaiya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Community Respiratory Centre, Khulna, Bangladesh Primary Care Respiratory Society (BPCRS), Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Ali', 'firstname': 'Mohsin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Community Respiratory Centre, Khulna, Bangladesh Primary Care Respiratory Society (BPCRS), Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Sultana', 'firstname': 'Mustarin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Community Respiratory Centre, Khulna, Bangladesh Primary Care Respiratory Society (BPCRS), Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Pinnock', 'firstname': 'Hilary', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Respiratory Health (RESPIRE), Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]"

Less is known about how medication use in children and adolescents has been affected by the pandemic.
To explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected drug utilisation in children and adolescents in Norway, Sweden, and Italy, by child age.
We conducted a longitudinal drug utilisation study among all children and adolescents (<18 years old) in Norway and Sweden and a nationwide paediatric database covering 3% of the paediatric population in Italy. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis from January 2018 to December 2021, with March 2020 as the interruption point. Dispensing or prescription rates of antidepressants, anxiolytics, sleep medications, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications, insulin, and asthma medications were examined.
The study population in January 2018 consisted of 3,455,521 children and adolescents (136,188 from Italy, 1,160,431 from Norway, and 2,158,902 from Sweden). For sleep medications and insulin, there were only minor changes in level or trend in some age groups after March 2020. For asthma medications, the pandemic was associated with an immediate decrease in dispensing in Norway and Sweden (range of change in level: -19.2 to -3.7 dispensings per 1000 person-months), and an increasing trend in all countries afterward (range of change in trend: 0.3-6.4 dispensings per 1000 person-months), especially for the youngest age groups. Among adolescents, the pandemic was associated with an increased trend for ADHD medications, antidepressants, and anxiolytics in Norway and Sweden, but not in Italy.

38299353,Modulation by ,2024-02-01,"Stress is an aversive stimulus which disrupts the biological milieu of the organism and a variety of emotional and environmental stressors are known to influence allergic and immunological disorders like bronchial asthma but the pharmacological basis of such interactions is not clearly defined. 
Wistar rats (200-250 g) were immunized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and exposed to restraint stress (RS) and WSE treatments for 15 days. Following this, anxiety behavior was assessed by the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and blood and BAL fluid samples were collected for measuring of inflammatory/immune markers by ELISA and biochemical assay. The data of the various treatment groups were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test.
Restraint stress (RS) induced anxiogenic behavior in the (EPM) test in OVA immunized rats, and this was attenuated by WSE (200 and 400 mg/kg), in a dose related manner. Examination of blood and BAL fluid in these RS exposed rats also resulted in elevations in IgE, TNF-α and IL-4 levels, which were also attenuated by WSE pretreatments.

38299207,Understanding the impact of socioeconomic and health factors on geriatric depression: A comparative study in rural and urban Bangladesh.,2024-02-01,"The prevalence of depression among the elderly is a growing concern, and this study examines the differences between urban and rural areas in terms of geriatric depression.
Using a two-stage random sampling approach in urban areas and a multistage random sampling approach in rural areas, the study surveyed 944 elderly individuals of both sexes.
The results indicate that the prevalence of depression was high, with 52.5% of the elderly population experiencing mild to severe depression. The study found that increasing age, female gender, nuclear family structure, and involvement of housewives or others were significant factors affecting depression in urban areas, while increasing age and elderly people without spouses were significant factors in rural areas. Additionally, the study identified hearing impairment, asthma, and arthritis as risk factors for depression in rural areas, and bronchitis, heart disease, and thyroid illness as significant factors in urban areas.
These findings highlight the need for policymakers to focus on addressing the mental health needs of older people, particularly women and those without spouses.","These findings highlight the need for policymakers to focus on addressing the mental health needs of older people, particularly women and those without spouses.","[{'lastname': 'Hossain', 'firstname': 'Mohammad Kamal', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University Gopalganj Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Islam', 'firstname': 'Md Nazrul', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics Shahjalal University of Science and Technology Sylhet Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Uddin', 'firstname': 'Mohammed Taj', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics Shahjalal University of Science and Technology Sylhet Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Hossain', 'firstname': 'Md Sabbir', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Statistics Shahjalal University of Science and Technology Sylhet Bangladesh.'}]"

This study aimed to investigate the incidence of hearing disability among older adults and identify the various factors contributing to its development.
In this matched nested case-control study, data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study from 2011 to 2018 were analyzed. A total of 4,523 older adults were recruited from a national sample database, of which 1,094 individuals were eligible for inclusion in the hearing disability cohort, while 3,429 older adults who had not been diagnosed with hearing disability were considered non-hearing disability controls. Hearing disability was assessed by a self-reported question. These controls were matched to hearing disability cases in a 1:1 ratio based on age and sex. The logistic regression models were used to find out various factors of hearing disability in the target population.
Totally 1,094 individuals (24.14%) developed hearing disability during the follow-up period. After 1:1 matching, 2,182 subjects were included in the study, with 1,091 cases in the case group. Factors that influenced the incidence of hearing disability in older adults included annual

38297283,Multivitamin consumption and childhood asthma: a cross-sectional study of the NHANES database.,2024-02-01,"Dietary intakes of vitamins are associated with asthma. However, previous studies mainly explored the association between a single vitamin intake and asthma, which did not take the multivitamins into consideration. Herein, this study aims to explore the overall effect of dietary multivitamins consumption on childhood asthma.
Data of children and adolescents (aged 2-17 years old) were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database in 2015-2018 in this cross-sectional study. Weighted univariate logistic regression analysis was used to screen covariates. The association between multivitamins (including vitamin A, C, D, E, B1, B2, B6, B12, K, niacin, folic acid, and choline) and childhood asthma was explored using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The evaluation indexes were odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We further introduced the Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to assess the joint effect of the twelve vitamins on childhood asthma, the impact of an individual vitamin as part of a vitamin mixture, and the potential interactions among different vitamins.
Among 4,715 eligible children and adolescents, 487 (10.3%) had asthma. After adjusting for covariates including race, family history of asthma, pregnant smoking, BMI Z-score, energy intake, breast feeding, and low birth weight, we found that for each 1-unit increase in vitamin K consumption, the odds of childhood asthma decreased 0.99 (P=0.028). The overall effect analysis reported a trend of negative relationship between the multivitamins and childhood asthma, especially at the 75th percentile and over. According to the BKMR models, when other vitamins are fixed at the median level, the odds of childhood asthma increased along with the elevated vitamin D (VD) and vitamin B2 (VB2), whereas along with the depressed vitamin C (VC). In addition, no potential interaction has been found between every two vitamins of multivitamins on childhood asthma.
Among children and adolescents who have high-risk of asthma, it may be beneficial to increase dietary consumption of multivitamins. Our findings recommended that children and adolescents should increase the intake of VC-rich foods, whereas control the dietary consumption of VD and VB2 in daily life.","Among children and adolescents who have high-risk of asthma, it may be beneficial to increase dietary consumption of multivitamins.

However, the usage patterns of drugs for obstructive airway diseases (R03 drugs) at the national level are not known.
The aims of this study were to describe (1) for which diagnoses each class of R03 drugs were used, (2) the usage pattern of different drug classes for asthma and COPD, and (3) how often these medications were used without a diagnosis of asthma or COPD in Finland.
We sent questionnaires that included questions on physician-diagnosed asthma and COPD to a random sample of 2000 Finnish subjects who had been dispensed R03 medications in the previous year. Details of R03 medications dispensed were retrieved from national registries.
Altogether, 803 subjects (40.6%) responded. Of these, 61.6% had asthma, 5.7% had both asthma and COPD, 5.1% had COPD, and 27.5% had neither asthma nor COPD. Among subjects with asthma or asthma and COPD, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were the most frequently dispensed class of drugs (93.7% and 97.8%, respectively). Even among subjects with COPD, ICS were dispensed as frequently (68.3%) as long-acting bronchodilators (70.7%). Antileukotrienes were dispensed mainly to asthmatic individuals only (18.4%) but far less frequently than ICS. The use of theophylline and roflumilast was rare.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the importance of lipid metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) in regulating the immune microenvironment in asthma remains lacking. The transcriptome matrix was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Differentially expressed analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) were conducted on the GSE74986 dataset to select hub LMRGs, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to explore their biological functions. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to determine immune infiltration in the asthma and control groups, and the correlation of diagnostic biomarkers and immune cells was performed via Spearman correlation analysis. Subsequently, a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed to investigate the hidden molecular mechanism of asthma. The expression levels of the hub genes were further validated in the GSE143192 dataset, and RT‒qPCR and immunofluorescence were performed to verify the reliability of the results in the OVA asthma model. Lastly, the ceRNA network was confirmed by qRT-PCR and RNAi experiments in the characteristic cytokine (IL-13)-induced asthma cellular model.

38296921,Effect of Individual Patient Characteristics and Treatment Choices on Reliever Medication Use in Moderate-Severe Asthma: A Poisson Analysis of Randomised Clinical Trials.,2024-02-01,"Even though increased use of reliever medication, including short-acting beta agonists (SABA), provides an indirect measure of symptom worsening, there have been limited efforts to assess how different patterns of reliever use correlate with symptom control and future risk of exacerbations. Here, we evaluate the effect of individual baseline characteristics on reliever use in patients with moderate-severe asthma on regular maintenance therapy with fluticasone propionate (FP) or combination therapy with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) or budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR).
A drug-disease model describing the number of 24-h puffs and overnight occasions was developed with data from five clinical studies (N = 6212). The model was implemented using a nonlinear mixed effects approach and a Poisson function, considering clinical and demographic baseline characteristics. Goodness of fit and model predictive performance were assessed. Heatmaps were created to summarise the effect of concurrent baseline factors on reliever utilisation.
The final model accurately described individual patterns of reliever use, which is significantly increased with time since diagnosis, smoking, higher Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) score and higher body mass index (BMI) at baseline. Whilst the number of puffs decreases slowly after an initial drop relative to the start of treatment, exacerbating patients utilise significantly more reliever than those who do not exacerbate. The mean effect of FP/SAL (median dose: 250/50 μg BID) on reliever use was slightly higher than that of BUD/FOR (median dose: 160/4.5 μg BID), i.e. a 75.3% vs 69.3% reduction in reliever use, respectively.
The availability of individual-level patient data in conjunction with a parametric approach enabled the characterisation of interindividual differences in the patterns of reliever use in patients with moderate-severe asthma. Taken together, individual demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as exacerbation history, can be considered an indicator of the degree of asthma control. High SABA reliever use suggests suboptimal clinical management of patients on maintenance therapy.
In this study, we tried to understand how patients with moderate to severe asthma use their quick-relief inhalers (like albuterol), how it relates to their symptoms and the risk of having asthma attacks. To evaluate whether differences in reliever inhaler use between patients are associated with factors like smoking or their asthma symptoms at the beginning of treatment, we gathered data from five clinical studies (n = 6212 patients). These data allowed us to create a model that predicts how often patients use their reliever inhalers (expressed as number of puffs in 24 h) during maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with long-acting beta agonists. The final model showed that reliever inhaler use is higher in patients who have been diagnosed with asthma for > 10 years, are smokers, have higher asthma symptom scores, and are obese or extremely obese. Patients who had asthma attacks also used their reliever inhalers more often. In addition, to understand how relief inhalers are used in real-life situations, we also created heatmaps that include a wide range of patient characteristics. By using individual patient data together with this model, we have learned that smoking, asthma control, BMI, long history of asthma and previous asthma attacks significantly influence reliever use. This information can help physicians and healthcare professionals understand know how well someone’s asthma is managed. A patient who uses their reliever inhaler often is likely not to have their asthma well controlled by their regular medications.",,"[{'lastname': 'van Dijkman', 'firstname': 'Sven C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacology Modelling and Simulation, GSK, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Yorgancıoğlu', 'firstname': 'Arzu', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Pavord', 'firstname': 'Ian', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Brusselle', 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Pitrez', 'firstname': 'Paulo M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Santa Casa de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Oosterholt', 'firstname': 'Sean', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacology Modelling and Simulation, GSK, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fumali', 'firstname': 'Sourabh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'GSK, Global Classic and Established Medicines, Worli, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Majumdar', 'firstname': 'Anurita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'GSK, Global Classic and Established Medicines, Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Della Pasqua', 'firstname': 'Oscar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics Group, University College London, BMA House, Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9JP, UK. odp72514@gsk.com.\nGSK House, 980 Great West Rd, London, TW8 9GS, UK. odp72514@gsk.com.'}]"

Macrolides statistically improved asthma control and quality of life but by less than the minimal clinically important difference. Peripheral blood eosinophil counts as well as serum and sputum eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations were significantly decreased with macrolides compared to placebo.

38296173,"The traditional utilization, biological activity and chemical composition of edible fern species.",2024-02-01,"Ferns form an important part of the human diet. Young fern fiddleheads are mostly consumed as vegetables, while the rhizomes are often extracted for starch. These edible ferns are also often employed in traditional medicine, where all parts of the plant are used, mostly to prepare extracts. These extracts are applied either externally as lotions and baths or internally as potions, decoctions and teas. Ailments traditionally treated with ferns include coughs, colds, fevers, pain, burns and wounds, asthma, rheumatism, diarrhoea, or skin diseases (eczema, rashes, itching, leprosy).
This review aims to compile the worldwide knowledge on the traditional medicinal uses of edible fern species correlating to reported biological activities and isolated bioactive compounds.
The articles and books published on edible fern species were searched through the online databases Web of Science, Pubmed and Google Scholar, with critical evaluation of the hits. The time period up to the end of 2022 was included.
First, the edible fern species were identified based on the literature data. A total of 90 fern species were identified that are eaten around the world and are also used in traditional medicine. Ailments treated are often associated with inflammation or bacterial infection. However, only the most common and well-known fern species, were investigated for their biological activity. The most studied species are Blechnum orientale L., Cibotium barometz (L.) J. Sm., Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Sw., Marsilea minuta L., Osmunda japonica Thunb., Polypodium vulgare L., and Stenochlaena palustris (Burm.) Bedd. Most of the fern extracts have been studied for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Not surprisingly, antioxidant capacity has been the most studied, with results reported for 28 edible fern species. Ferns have been found to be very rich sources of flavonoids, polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, terpenoids and steroids and most of these compounds are remarkable free radical scavengers responsible for the outstanding antioxidant capacity of fern extracts. As far as clinical trials are concerned, extracts from only three edible fern species have been evaluated.
The extracts of edible fern species exert antioxidant anti-inflammatory and related biological activities, which is consistent with their traditional medicinal use in the treatment of wounds, burns, colds, coughs, skin diseases and intestinal diseases. However, studies to prove pharmacological activities are scarce, and require chemical-biological standardization. Furthermore, correct botanical classification needs to be included in publications to simplify data acquisition. Finally, more in-depth phytochemical studies, allowing the linking of traditional use to pharmacological relevance are needed to be done in a standardized way.",,"[{'lastname': 'Dvorakova', 'firstname': 'Marcela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Experimental Botany, Rozvojova 263, CZ-16200, Prague 6, Czech Republic.

38296088,Indoor air pollution is associated with respiratory symptoms in children in urban Vietnam.,2024-02-01,"Exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP) is a leading environmental risk for respiratory diseases. We investigated the relationship between respiratory symptoms and polluting indoor activities such as smoking, cooking and contact with pets among children in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. A cross-sectional survey applied a multistage sampling method in 24 randomly selected secondary schools across the city. Approximately 15,000 students completed self-administrated questionnaires on risk factors and respiratory health outcomes within the preceding 12 months. Data were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model with robust standard errors. Wheeze was the most common respiratory symptom (39.5 %) reported, followed by sneezing and runny nose (28.3 %). A small percentage of students self-reported asthma (8.6 %). Approximately 56 % of participants lived with family members who smoked. A positive association between exposure to indoor secondhand smoke and respiratory symptoms was observed, with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 1.41 (95 % CI: 1.25-1.60, p < 0.001) for wheezing and 1.64 (95 % CI: 1.43-1.87, p < 0.001) for sneezing and runny nose, respectively. Using an open stove fuelled by coal, wood, or kerosene for cooking was associated with wheeze (aOR: 1.36, CI 95 %: 1.10-1.68, p = 0.01) and sneezing and runny nose (aOR: 1.36, CI 95 %: 1.09-1.69, p = 0.01).

There is a paucity of data describing the demographics and impact of ILO. We aimed to report the clinical and demographic features of ILO in individuals entered prospectively in the UK national ILO registry.
Data were entered into a Web-based registry from participants with endoscopically confirmed ILO who were attending four established UK-wide specialist ILO centers between March 2017 and November 2019. All patients provided written informed consent.
Data from 137 individuals were included. Most (87%) had inspiratory ILO and required provocation during endoscopy to induce symptoms. There was a female predominance (80%), mean age 47 years (SD, 15 years). The most common comorbidities included asthma (68%) and reflux (57%). Health care use was high: 88% had attended emergency health care with symptoms at least once in the previous 12 months and nearly half had been admitted to the hospital. A fifth had required admission to critical care owing to ILO symptoms. Patient morbidity was substantial; 64% reported impaired functional capacity (≥3 on the Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale) and a third stated that symptoms affected working capability.
We describe the first multicenter prospective characterization of individuals with endoscopically diagnosed ILO. Analysis of our multicenter data set identified ILO as associated with a high burden of morbidity and health care use, comparable to severe asthma.

However, only few studies focused on Asian Americans and little is known about the association with multiple comorbidity.
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among 400 Chinese and Korean American participants (aged 50-75 years) of the STOP CRC randomized controlled trial. Perceived distress was assessed using the distress thermometer scale (range 0-10). Disease diagnosis was self-reported by the participants. Multimorbidity (MM) was defined as having ≥2 chronic conditions. Complex multimorbidity (CMM) was defined as having ≥3 of the following body system disorders: circulation disorder, endocrine-metabolic disorder, cancer, anxiety or depression, breathing problem, and other health problems. We performed logistic regression for CMM and Poisson regression with robust error variance for MM to estimate associations with distress, adjusting for potential confounders.
The mean age was 58.4 years and mean distress score was 3.65. One-unit increase in distress score was associated with a 1.22-fold increase in the odds of having CMM (95% CI: 1.04-1.42).

The correlation between serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 levels and airway remodeling in children with severe BA was analyzed by bivariate correlation Pearson (N). Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between serum TLR4, sICAM-1 levels, and recurrence in children with severe BA. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the predictive value of serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 for recurrence in children with severe BA; R4.1.0 statistical software was used to draw the decision curve of serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 levels to predict the recurrence of severe BA in children with a high-risk threshold as abscissa and net return rate as ordinate.
Among the 120 children with severe BA, 46 cases recurred during the 1-year follow-up period, with a recurrence rate of 38.33 %. The proportion of premature delivery and children with allergic rhinitis in the recurrent group was higher than that in the non-recurrent group, and the levels of eosinophil count, TLR4, and sICAM-1 were higher than those in the non-recurrent group (P < .001). The levels of T/D and WA% in the recurrent group were higher than those in the non-recurrent group (P < .001). The results of bivariate correlation Pearson (N) analysis showed that serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 levels were positively correlated with T/D and WA% in children with severe BA (r >0, P < .001); the results of ROC curve showed that the AUC of serum TLR4, sICAM-1 and combined detection in predicting the recurrence of children with severe BA were all > 0.70, which had certain predictive value, and the combined detection was the highest. The decision curve was drawn. The results showed that the net rate of return of serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 in predicting the recurrence of children with severe BA was better than that of a single net rate of return in the range of 0.217~0.284 and 0.296~0.492. In the range of high-risk threshold 0.000-0.958, the net rate of return of serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 combined to predict the recurrence of severe BA children was > 0, which was of clinical significance.
The serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 levels are closely related to airway remodeling and recurrence in children with severe BA, and their levels can effectively predict the risk of recurrence.","The serum TLR4 and sICAM-1 levels are closely related to airway remodeling and recurrence in children with severe BA, and their levels can effectively predict the risk of recurrence.","[{'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Qiaozhi', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Xian', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Xueqin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}]"
38294718,Insight into the role of mitochondrion-related gene anchor signature in mitochondrial dysfunction of neutrophilic asthma.,2024-01-31,"At present, targeting molecular-pharmacological therapy is still difficult in neutrophilic asthma. The investigation aims to identify and validate mitochondrion-related gene signatures for diagnosis and specific targeting therapeutics in neutrophilic asthma.
Bronchial biopsy samples of neutrophilic asthma and healthy people were identified from the GSE143303 dataset and then matched with human mitochondrial gene data to obtain mitochondria-related differential genes (MitoDEGs). Signature mitochondria-related diagnostic markers were jointly screened by support vector machine (SVM) analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The expression of marker MitoDEGs was evaluated by validation datasets GSE147878 and GSE43696. The diagnostic value was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Meanwhile, the infiltrating immune cells were analyzed by the CIBERSORT. Finally, oxidative stress level and mitochondrial functional morphology for asthmatic mice and BEAS-2B cells were evaluated. The expression of signature MitoDEGs was verified by qPCR.
67 MitoDEGs were identified. Five signature MitoDEGs (SOD2, MTHFD2, PPTC7, NME6, and SLC25A18) were further screened out. The area under the curve (AUC) of signature MitoDEGs presented a good diagnostic performance (more than 0.9). There were significant differences in the expression of signature MitoDEGs between neutrophilic asthma and non-neutrophilic asthma. In addition, the basic features of mitochondrial dysfunction were demonstrated by

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab are associated with pneumonia in a real-world setting.
A retrospective disproportionality analysis was performed using adverse event (AE) reports submitted to FAERS from January 2020 to September 30, 2023. MedDRA was used to identify infections and infestations and then pneumonia cases. ROR and PRR were used to measure disproportionality.
The percentage of reported cases of pneumonia compared to infections and infestations was highest for mepolizumab (36.8%), followed by omalizumab (32.6%), benralizumab (19.2%) and dupilumab (5.7%). We found a moderate or strong signal for increased risk of pneumonia with mepolizumab (ROR = 3.74, 95%CI 3.50-4.00), omalizumab (ROR = 3.26, 95%CI 3.06-3.49) and benralizumab (ROR = 2.65, 95%CI 2.49-2.83).
Mepolizumab, omalizumab and benralizumab, but not dupilumab, were associated with high odds of reporting pneumonia. Our results represent only potential associations between these biologics and pneumonia but not causality. The nature of the FAERS database is such that the cause of the reported events is uncertain. Therefore, we can only roughly estimate the incidence of AEs by the signal strength (ROR value). Nevertheless, although causality could not be assessed, the signal from our study is interesting.

38294683,Atomized inhalation of Icaritin reduces airway inflammation and remodeling in asthmatic mice.,2024-01-31,"Asthma is a disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. Icaritin (ICT) is a plant hormone with various pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, immune regulation, and anti-tumor. This study mainly explored the effects of nebulized inhalation of ICT on airway inflammation and airway remodeling in asthmatic mice.
Different groups of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma mice with acute and chronic airway inflammation received ICT. Asthmatic mice received budesonide (BDND) aerosol inhalation as a positive control, while normal control and asthma model mice received the same volume of saline. Following finishing of the study, analyses were conducted on behavioral tests, biochemical indices, and histological structures of lung tissues.
Aerosol inhalation of ICT can notably reduce inflammatory cells infiltration around the airways and pulmonary vessels, and suppressed goblet cell hyperplasia in asthmatic mice. Long-term inhalation of ICT can decrease airway collagen deposition and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia, and alleviate airway hyperresponsiveness, mirroring the effects observed with hormone employed in clinical practice.
Nebulized inhalation of ICT can effectively inhibit airway inflammation in asthmatic mice, improve airway remodeling, and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness, with effects similar to those of hormones. It may serve as a potential candidate used as a hormone replacement asthma treatment.","Nebulized inhalation of ICT can effectively inhibit airway inflammation in asthmatic mice, improve airway remodeling, and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness, with effects similar to those of hormones.

38294623,Epidemiology of Pertussis and Pertussis-Related Complications in Adults: A German Claims Data Analysis.,2024-01-31,"Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory infection. It affects people of all ages, yet evidence of the impact of pertussis in adults with underlying conditions (UCs) is scarce. This study investigated the incidence and complication rate of pertussis in adult patients with and without UC.
A retrospective analysis was conducted using routinely collected German claims data between 2015 and 2019. Patients with and without different pneumological, cardiovascular, endocrinological, musculoskeletal, and psychological UCs were matched for incidence estimation. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of pertussis depending on the presence of UCs. Negative binomial models were used to assess complication rates in patients with pertussis and with and without UC.
In total, 4383 patients were diagnosed with pertussis during the study period. Patients with any UC had an increased risk for pertussis compared to matched patients without UC (odds ratio [OR] 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]1.60-1.84, p < 0.0001). Underlying asthma had the highest risk of pertussis (OR 2.70; 95% CI 2.50-2.91, p < 0.0001), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.35; 95% CI 2.10-2.60, p < 0.0001) and depression (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.95-2.22, p < 0.0001). Severe complications occurred in 10.8% of the pertussis cohort (13.4% with UC vs. 9.5% without UC). The UC-attributable effect on the risk of severe pertussis-related complications was significantly increased for any UC (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.39). The severe complication risk was also increased for patients aged 60+ (IRR 1.59, 95% CI 1.46-1.72).
This study shows that adults with certain UCs have an increased risk for pertussis and are more likely to have complications. These results provide further evidence that pertussis is a relevant and impactful infectious disease in adults with and without certain UC, indicating that these patients need to be considered when developing vaccination recommendations to avoid pertussis and its associated complications.

Makino. In mice, G. pentaphyllum extract and gypenoside LXXV have been shown to improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study investigated whether gypenoside XIII can regulate lipid accumulation in fatty liver cells or attenuate NASH in mice. We used HepG2 hepatocytes to establish a fatty liver cell model using 0.5 mM oleic acid. Fatty liver cells were treated with different concentrations of gypenoside XIII to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism. In addition, a methionine/choline-deficient diet induced NASH in C57BL/6 mice, which were given 10 mg/kg gypenoside XIII by intraperitoneal injection. In fatty liver cells, gypenoside XIII effectively suppressed lipid accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, gypenoside XIII significantly increased SIRT1 and AMPK phosphorylation to decrease acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation, reducing fatty acid synthesis activity. Gypenoside XIII also decreased lipogenesis by suppressing sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and fatty acid synthase production. Gypenoside XIII also increased lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation by promoting adipose triglyceride lipase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, respectively. In an animal model of NASH, gypenoside XIII effectively decreased the lipid vacuole size and number and reduced liver fibrosis and inflammation.

38293814,Tumor markers for lipid metabolism-related genes: Based on small cell lung cancer and bronchial asthma dual analysis.,2024-01-31,"Numerous studies have elucidated the intricate relationship between bronchial asthma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as well as the role lipid metabolism genes play in transitioning from bronchial asthma to SCLC. Despite this, the predictive power of single gene biomarkers remains insufficient and necessitates the development of more accurate prognostic models. In our study, we downloaded and preprocessed scRNA-seq of SCLC from the GEO database GSE164404 and severe asthma scRNA-seq from GSE145013 using the Seurat package. Using the MSigDB database and geneCard database, we selected lipid metabolism-related genes and performed scRNA-seq data analysis from the gene expression GEO database, aiming to uncover potential links between immune signaling pathways in bronchial asthma and SCLC. Our investigations yielded differentially expressed genes based on the scRNA-seq dataset related to lipid metabolism. We executed differential gene analysis, gene ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. In-depth GSEA pathway activation analysis, crucial target gene predictions via protein-protein interactions, and key cluster gene evaluations for differential and diagnostic ROC values correlation analysis confirmed that key cluster genes are significant predictors for the progression of bronchial asthma to SCLC. To validate our findings, we performed wet laboratory experiments using real-time quantitative PCR to assess the expression of these relevant genes in SCLC cell lines. In conclusion, this research proposes a novel lipid metabolism-related gene marker that can offer comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma leading to SCLC. Although this study does not directly focus on senescence-associated molecular alterations, our findings in the lipid metabolism genes associated with inflammation and cancer progression offer valuable insights for further research targeting senescence-related changes in treating inflammatory diseases.",,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiaobin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tangdu Hospital of Air Force Medical University, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tangdu Hospital of Air Force Medical University, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Haiqiang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tangdu Hospital of Air Force Medical University, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Xiaokang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tangdu Hospital of Air Force Medical University, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bao', 'firstname': 'Peilong', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tangdu Hospital of Air Force Medical University, China.'}]"

38293162,Genome-wide SNP-sex interaction analysis of susceptibility to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,2024-01-31,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung condition that is more prevalent in males than females. The reasons for this are not fully understood, with differing environmental exposures due to historically sex-biased occupations, or diagnostic bias, being possible explanations. To date, over 20 independent genetic variants have been identified to be associated with IPF susceptibility, but these have been discovered when combining males and females. Our aim was to test for the presence of sex-specific associations with IPF susceptibility and assess whether there is a need to consider sex-specific effects when evaluating genetic risk in clinical prediction models for IPF.
We performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-by-sex interaction studies of IPF risk in six independent IPF case-control studies and combined them using inverse-variance weighted fixed effect meta-analysis. In total, 4,561 cases (1,280 females and 2,281 males) and 23,500 controls (8,360 females and 14,528 males) of European genetic ancestry were analysed. We used polygenic risk scores (PRS) to assess differences in genetic risk prediction between males and females.
Three independent genetic association signals were identified. All showed a consistent direction of effect across all individual IPF studies and an opposite direction of effect in IPF susceptibility between females and males. None had been previously identified in IPF susceptibility genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The predictive accuracy of the PRSs were similar between males and females, regardless of whether using combined or sex-specific GWAS results.
We prioritised three genetic variants whose effect on IPF risk may be modified by sex, however these require further study. We found no evidence that the predictive accuracy of common SNP-based PRSs varies significantly between males and females.",,"[{'lastname': 'Leavy', 'firstname': 'Olivia C', 'initials': 'OC',

38293040,Risk Factors for Pediatric Critical COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2024-01-31,"Risk stratification is a cornerstone of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society COVID-19 treatment guidance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to define the clinical characteristics and comorbidities associated with critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents.
Two independent reviewers screened the literature (Medline and EMBASE) for studies published through August 2023 that reported outcome data on patients aged ≤21 years with COVID-19. Critical disease was defined as an invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, or death. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analyses.
Among 10,178 articles, 136 studies met the inclusion criteria for review. Data from 70 studies, which collectively examined 172,165 children and adolescents with COVID-19, were pooled for meta-analysis. In previously healthy children, the absolute risk of critical disease from COVID-19 was 4% (95% CI, 1%-10%). Compared with no comorbidities, the pooled OR for critical disease was 3.95 (95% CI, 2.78-5.63) for presence of one comorbidity and 9.51 (95% CI, 5.62-16.06) for ≥2 comorbidities. Key risk factors included cardiovascular and neurological disorders, chronic pulmonary conditions (excluding asthma), diabetes, obesity, and immunocompromise, all with statistically significant ORs >2.00.
While the absolute risk for critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents without underlying health conditions is relatively low, the presence of one or more comorbidities was associated with markedly increased risk.

Generally, AR is accompanied by asthma and conjunctivitis. The risk factors of AR include both inhalant and occupational allergens and genetic factors. Although AR is not a life-threatening condition, it poses a significant risk of morbidity and hampers work-related performance. Currently, the diagnosis of AR is based on clinical history and physical examination of the patients. Furthermore, several laboratory tests such as skin pricking test (SPT), nasal allergen challenge (NAC), and computed tomography (CT) are also recommended in some cases. Nasal cytology can aid in the differentiation of rhinitis because of allergy or infection. Apart from this, molecular diagnostic modalities such as basophil activation test (BAT) and Immune Solid-Phase Allergy Chip (ISAC) can also be employed for the confirmatory diagnosis of AR. Immunotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in the management of AR, with only mild side effects. With the advancement in the diagnostic realm of AR, personalized treatment approach has also gained significant popularity.

38292919,Knowledge and Practice of Healthcare Professionals in the Medical Care of Asthma Adult Patients in Jordan with a Particular Reference to Adherence to GINA Recommendations.,2024-01-31,"This study aimed to evaluate Jordanian healthcare professionals' knowledge, skills, and experience in dealing with and treating adult asthmatic patients and assess healthcare professionals' compliance with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline recommendations for asthma treatment and management in Jordan.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Jordan between May and June 2023. This study included physicians, pharmacists, and nurses working in clinical settings and directly interacting with asthma patients in Jordan's private and governmental healthcare facilities who were eligible to participate in this research. Three primary sections of an online survey were constructed using Google Forms and included demographic data, a diagnosis and management of the illness, and a list of worldwide medical references for asthma.
A total of 300 healthcare professionals, including pharmacists (103), nurses (87), Doctor of Pharmacy (28), and physicians (82), took part in this research. The survey respondents' general knowledge of the nature and symptoms of asthma is quite high, exceeding 84% and 86%, respectively. The survey also showed a high degree of awareness of asthma diagnosis. It was also revealed that around one-quarter of participants consistently reported the severity of asthma. The most frequent factor influencing the decision to take controller or maintenance medicines is symptom severity (reported from 86% of participants). The GINA guidelines were selected as the asthma information source by almost half of the participants. Finally, 47% of participants were aware of the GINA's 2019 adjustments of the recommendations.
This study showed that Jordanian healthcare professionals understand the nature, symptoms, and diagnoses of asthma disease. However, many of the survey participants lack adherence, awareness, and understanding of the GINA recommendations about asthma management. More research is required to assess the adherence to the evidence-based recommendations and evaluate the impact of training courses.","This study showed that Jordanian healthcare professionals understand the nature, symptoms, and diagnoses of asthma disease.

38292857,Obesity-related asthma and its relationship with microbiota.,2024-01-31,"Obesity and asthma are global public health problems. Obesity-related asthma is a special phenotype of asthma with a complex pathogenesis. Its occurrence and development are related to mechanical compression, inflammatory response, metabolic regulation, gene regulation, and vitamin D deficiency. Different treatment strategies used in the process of weight loss have a beneficial impact on asthma. Alterations in gut and airway microbial community structure and their metabolites may also contribute to obesity-related asthma. The role of the Th17/Treg balance in the gut microbiota regulating the immune responses and host metabolism is important. Therapeutic measures associated with the gut microbiota variety may contribute to improving chronic inflammation associated with obesity by regulating the Th17/Treg balance. An early reduction in microbial diversity can predict the development of asthma and lead to allergy through an imbalance of Th2/Th1 responses. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate the differentiation and activation of regulatory T cells, thereby regulating immune homeostasis in the lung to suppress allergic inflammation and weight gain. Therefore, clarifying the microbial mechanism of obesity-related asthma has important guiding significance for clinical treatment. In this review, we used the following terms: ""asthma and obesity"" and ""obesity-related asthma"", combining ""phenotype"", ""airway inflammation"" and ""lung function"", and reviewed the characteristics and pathogenesis of obesity-related asthma, the relationship between the gut and airway microbiota and obesity-related asthma, and the current treatment measures for the disease.",,"[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Jinli', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Xuehua', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Bo', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Hong', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Qiuhong', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Department of Geriatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Xin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}]"
38292490,High-dimensional comparison of monocytes and T cells in post-COVID and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,2024-01-31,"Up to 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients experience persistent sequelae, including pulmonary fibrosis (PF).
We examined COVID-19 survivors with impaired lung function and imaging worrisome for developing PF and found within six months, symptoms, restriction and PF improved in some (Early-Resolving COVID-PF), but persisted in others (Late-Resolving COVID-PF). To evaluate immune mechanisms associated with recovery versus persistent PF, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunostaining on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with Early- and Late-Resolving COVID-PF and compared them to age-matched controls without respiratory disease.
Our analysis showed circulating monocytes were significantly reduced in Late-Resolving COVID-PF patients compared to Early-Resolving COVID-PF and non-diseased controls. Monocyte abundance correlated with pulmonary function forced vital capacity and diffusion capacity. Differential expression analysis revealed MHC-II class molecules were upregulated on the CD8 T cells of Late-Resolving COVID-PF patients but downregulated in monocytes. To determine whether these immune signatures resembled other interstitial lung diseases, we analyzed samples from Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients.

38292138,Real-World Disease Burden and Healthcare Resource Utilization Among Patients with COPD and Asthma Using Triple Therapy (FF/UMEC/VI) in the United States.,2024-01-31,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are associated with chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract; despite some overlap of symptoms, they are considered separate disorders. Triple therapy is recommended for patients with COPD and asthma whose symptoms remain uncontrolled despite dual therapy. There are limited real-world studies evaluating outcomes among patients with COPD and asthma who are receiving inhaled triple therapy. This United States (US)-based real-world study aimed to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes among patients with COPD and asthma receiving single-inhaler triple therapy (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol [FF/UMEC/VI]).
Retrospective pre-post study using claims data from the Optum Clinformatics
Overall, 2743 patients were included (mean age: 71 years; 64% female). Cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent comorbidity during both the pre- and post-treatment periods (90% for both periods). There was a lower proportion of patients with ≥1 COPD exacerbation or ≥1 asthma exacerbation post-treatment versus pre-treatment (51% vs 57%, p<0.0001, and 22% vs 32%, p<0.0001, respectively). Fewer patients had ≥1 all-cause office visit post-treatment versus pre-treatment (99.3% vs 99.7%, p=0.0329); more patients had ≥1 COPD-related office visit post-treatment versus pre-treatment (89.6% vs 87.5%, p=0.0035). Total all-cause healthcare costs were significantly higher post-treatment versus pre-treatment ($72,809 vs $63,734, p<0.0001). The driver of increased costs appeared to be primarily non-COPD-related (COPD-related costs: post-treatment $27,779 vs pre-treatment $25,081, p=0.0062).

Studies suggest a potential link between dietary antioxidants, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This study aimed to compare the dietary intake of antioxidants in asthmatic and healthy women, evaluating their potential associations with inflammation and oxidative stress. This study analyzed 30 asthmatic and 30 healthy women's lung function, anthropometry, biochemical parameters, and dietary antioxidant intake using a 161-itemized semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Additionally, the study explored connections between serum inflammatory markers and oxidative stress indicators in relation to dietary intake of antioxidant nutrients and flavonoids. Asthmatic women exhibited higher serum IL-6 levels and lower total antioxidant status compared to healthy controls. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed in dietary antioxidant micronutrient intake. Healthy controls demonstrated a notably higher intake of anthocyanidins compared to asthmatic women. Furthermore, the study identified a negative correlation between flavonol intake and serum total oxidant status, as well as between flavan-3-ols intake and serum oxidative stress index. Dietary differences in flavonoid and flavonoid-rich foods intake among asthmatic women may affect their serum IL-6 levels and oxidative stress.

The specific effects of sleep on allergic diseases, however, are less well-established; hence, in a unique population of young Chinese adults, we investigated the association between sleep and allergic disease.
Young Chinese adults recruited from Singapore in the Singapore/Malaysia Cross-Sectional Genetic Epidemiology Study (SMCGES) were analyzed. We used the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) protocol and a skin prick test to determine atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma status. Information regarding total sleep time (TST) and sleep quality (SQ) was also obtained.
Of 1558 participants with a mean age of 25.0 years (SD = 7.6), 61.4% were female, and the mean total sleep time (TST) was 6.8 h (SD = 1.1). The proportions of AD, AR, and asthma were 24.5% (393/1542), 36.4% (987/1551), and 14.7% (227/1547), respectively. 59.8% (235/393) of AD cases suffered from AD-related sleep disturbances, 37.1% (209/564) of AR cases suffered from AR-related sleep disturbances, and 25.1% (57/227) of asthma cases suffered from asthma-related sleep disturbances. Only asthma cases showed a significantly lower mean TST than those without asthma (p = 0.015). Longer TST was significantly associated with lower odds of AR (OR = 0.905, 95% CI = 0.820-0.999) and asthma (OR = 0.852, 95% CI = 0.746-0.972). Linear regression analyses showed that lower TST was significantly associated with asthma (β =  - 0.18, SE = 0.076, p-value = 0.017), and AR when adjusted for AR-related sleep disturbances (β =  - 0.157, SE = 0.065, p-value = 0.016). Only sleep disturbances due to AR were significantly associated with a poorer SQ (OR = 1.962, 95% CI = 1.245-3.089).
We found that sleep quality, but not sleep duration was significantly poorer among AD cases, although the exact direction of influence could not be determined. In consideration of the literature coupled with our findings, we posit that TST influences allergic rhinitis rather than vice versa. Finally, the association between TST and asthma is likely mediated by asthma-related sleep disturbances, since mean TST was significantly lower among those with nighttime asthma symptoms. Future studies could consider using objective sleep measurements coupled with differential expression analysis to investigate the pathophysiology of sleep and allergic diseases.",,"[{'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Qi Yi Ambrose', 'initials': 'QYA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Allergy and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Lee Hiok Kwee Functional Genomics Laboratories, Block S2, Level 5, 14 Science Drive 4, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 117543, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Jun Jie', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Allergy and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Lee Hiok Kwee Functional Genomics Laboratories, Block S2, Level 5, 14 Science Drive 4, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 117543, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Ng', 'firstname': 'Jun Yan', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Allergy and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Lee Hiok Kwee Functional Genomics Laboratories, Block S2, Level 5, 14 Science Drive 4, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 117543, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Yi Ying Eliza', 'initials': 'YYE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Allergy and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Lee Hiok Kwee Functional Genomics Laboratories, Block S2, Level 5, 14 Science Drive 4, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 117543, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Sio', 'firstname': 'Yang Yie', 'initials': 'YY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Allergy and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Lee Hiok Kwee Functional Genomics Laboratories, Block S2, Level 5, 14 Science Drive 4, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 117543, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Chew', 'firstname': 'Fook Tim', 'initials': 'FT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Allergy and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Lee Hiok Kwee Functional Genomics Laboratories, Block S2, Level 5, 14 Science Drive 4, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 117543, Singapore. dbscft@nus.edu.sg.'}]"

There are currently several classes of biologics approved for severe asthma including anti-immunoglobulin E, anti-interleukin-5/interleukin 5R, anti-interleukin 4/interleukin 13R, and anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin.
Here we report the case of a 55-year-old Caucasian man with severe eosinophilic atopic asthma, who sequentially benefited from a treatment with mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, followed by treatment with dupilumab, an anti-interleukin-4/interleukin-13R antibody, the switch being justified by a flare-up of dermatitis while on mepolizumab. Overall, the patient has been followed for 72 months, including 42 months on mepolizumab and 30 months on dupilumab. Close monitoring of exacerbations, asthma control, lung function, asthma quality of life, and biomarkers shows that both biologics reduced asthma exacerbation and provided an improvement in asthma control and quality of life, with the patient achieving remission after 30 months on dupilumab. However, the effects of the two biologics on the biomarkers were very different, with mepolizumab controlling eosinophilic inflammation and dupilumab reducing serum immunoglobulin E and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels.
The originality of this case resides in the description of clinical status and biomarker evolution after a sequential use of mepolizumab and dupilumab in a severe atopic eosinophilic asthmatic.

Treatment with PF543 prior to triple allergen exposure (DRA: House dust mite, Ragweed pollen and Aspergillus) reduced inflammation, eosinophilic response, and GCM followed by reduced airway hyperreactivity to intravenous methacholine. Further, DRA exposure was associated with increased expression of SPHK1 in the airway epithelium which was reduced by PF543.

Age differences may have potential effects on asthma phenotypes. Our study aimed to identify potential asthma phenotypes among adults divided by age as either younger or older than 65 years. We also compared differences in blood granulocyte patterns, occupational asthmagens, and asthma control-related outcomes among patient phenotype clusters.
We recruited nonelderly (<65 years old) (n = 726) and elderly adults (≥65 years old) (n = 201) with mild-to-severe asthma. We conducted a factor analysis to select 17 variables. A two-step cluster analysis was used to classify subjects with asthma phenotypes, and a discriminant analysis was used to verify the classification of cluster results.
There were three clusters with different characteristics identified in both the nonelderly and elderly asthmatic adults. In the nonelderly patient group, cluster 2 (obese, neutrophilic phenotypes) had a 1.85-fold significantly increased risk of asthma exacerbations. Cluster 3 (early-onset, atopy, and smoker with an eosinophil-predominant pattern) had a 2.37-fold risk of asthma exacerbations and higher oral corticosteroid (OCS) use than cluster 1 (late-onset and LMW exposure with paucigranulocytic blood pattern). Among elderly patients, cluster 2 had poor lung function and more ex-smokers. Cluster 3 (early-onset, long asthma duration) had the lowest paucigranulocytic blood pattern percentages in the elderly group.
The novelty of the clusters was found in age-dependent clusters.

We used the Virtual Pediatric System database to estimate NRS by prescribing rates for pediatric critical asthma and characterize patient clinical features and in-patient outcomes by the initial NRS device applied.
We performed a retrospective cohort study from 125 participating pediatric ICUs among children 2-17 years of age hospitalized for critical asthma and prescribed NRS from 2017 through 2021. The primary outcomes were NRS modality prescribing rates and trends. Secondary outcomes were descriptive and included demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness indices, and NRS failure rates (defined as escalation from the initial NRS modality to invasive ventilation, HFNC to BPAP or CPAP, or CPAP to BPAP).
Of the 10,083 encounters studied, the initial NRS modalities prescribed varied widely by hospital center (HFNC: 69.7 ± 29.6%; BPAP: 27.2 ± 7.1%; CPAP: 3.1 ± 5.9%). The mean rates of HFNC use increased from 59.7% in 2017 to 71.9% in 2021 (+2.5%/y). In contrast, BPAP (-1.6%/y) and CPAP (-0.8%/y) utilization declined throughout the study period. Older children who were obese and with a higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality III-Probability of Mortality score were more frequently prescribed BPAP and CPAP compared with HFNC. Those children on HFNC experienced higher noninvasive respiratory support failure rates versus BPAP (7.3% vs 2.4%; 
In this multi-center cohort study, we observed that children with critical asthma are increasingly exposed to HFNC compared with BPAP and CPAP. Rates of HFNC failure were greater than those of BPAP failure, but a majority were transitioned to BPAP without subsequent invasive ventilation.

38290164,Early-life Pulmonary Viral Infection Leads to Long-term Functional and lower airway Structural changes in the lungs.,2024-01-30,"Early-life respiratory virus infections have been correlated with enhanced development of childhood asthma. In particular, significant numbers of RSV-hospitalized infants go on to develop lung disease. It has been suggested that early-life viral infections may lead to altered lung development or repair that negatively impacts lung function later in life. Our data demonstrate that early-life RSV infection modifies lung structure, leading to decreased lung function. At 5 weeks post-neonatal RSV infection, significant defects are observed in baseline pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters consistent with decreased lung function as well as enlarged alveolar spaces. Lung function changes in the early-life RSV-infected group continue at 3 months of age. The altered PFT and structural changes induced by early-life RSV were mitigated in TSLPR-/- mice that have previously been shown to have reduced immune cell accumulation associated with a persistent Th2 environment. Importantly, long-term effects were demonstrated using a secondary RSV infection 3 months following the initial early-life RSV infection and led to significant additional defects in lung function, with severe mucus deposition within the airways, and consolidation of the alveolar spaces. These studies suggest that early-life respiratory viral infection leads to alterations in lung structure/repair that predispose to diminished lung function later in life.",,"[{'lastname': 'Malinczak', 'firstname': 'Carrie-Anne', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Pathology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Fonseca', 'firstname': 'Wendy', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Pathology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hrycaj', 'firstname': 'Steven M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Pathology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Morris', 'firstname': 'Susan B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Pathology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Rasky', 'firstname': 'Andrew J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Pathology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Yagi', 'firstname': 'Kazuma', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Pathology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wellik', 'firstname': 'Deneen M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin Health, Madison, WI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ziegler', 'firstname': 'Steven F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Zemans', 'firstname': 'Rachel L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Lukacs', 'firstname': 'Nicholas W', 'initials': 'NW', 'affiliation': 'Pathology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}]"
38290114,Challenging Case: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Demystifying Chronic Sleep Impairment in an Infant with a Complex Medical and Behavioral Profile.,2024-01-30,"X is a 22-month-old White male infant with a complex medical history, including diagnoses of FBXO11 mutation, hypotonia, restrictive lung disease and mild intermittent asthma, laryngotracheomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), feeding difficulties with a history of aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and developmental delays. X's medical presentation has resulted in multiple prior medical admissions for respiratory failure due to acute illnesses, procedures and treatments including gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tube dependence, supraglottoplasty to reshape tissues of the upper larynx, and the use of biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP) at night and room air during the day when he is at baseline. In addition, he has nocturnal events characterized by significant agitation, screaming, crying, body stiffening and limb movements with pauses in breathing, mouth breathing, restless sleep, and difficulty waking in the morning with concomitant daytime fatigue despite above treatments for OSA. There is no history of congenital heart disease or sudden unexplained death. Family history is noncontributory because parents are negative for the FBXO11 variant.X's sleep disruption has led to significant sleep deficits for both X and his caregivers, who spend much of the night strategizing on how to console him. X has undergone several sleep studies, starting when X was aged 4 months, at several children's hospitals across the nation to determine the cause of his chronic sleep disturbance, which yielded limited information and treatment success. As an infant, X received a medical workup and was subsequently treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for reflux. At 12 months, he was diagnosed with disordered sleep with myoclonic jerks and started on melatonin and gabapentin for involuntary movements. At 13 months, gabapentin was weaned back because of intolerance, and at 15 months, nortriptyline and clonidine were started because of worsening symptoms to target potential neuropathic pain. While most of his symptoms were at night, he had occasional daytime screaming episodes, particularly when experiencing illness. Gabapentin and clonidine were stopped because nortriptyline seemed most effective.At 17 months, the results from a sleep study led to a diagnosis of night terrors, and several clinicians agreed that X's sleep disruption was behavioral in nature. At this time, an infant mental health consultant met with a sleep psychologist on the family's behalf to support family in considering systematic desensitization therapy to increase tolerance to wearing his BiPAP mask, as well as other behavioral and sleep hygiene strategies, which were tried on several occasions and again, resulted in limited improvement in functioning.At 19 months, X's multidisciplinary team reconsidered a night terror diagnosis after a failed trial of clonazepam and pursued a differential diagnosis of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). X trialed gabapentin again, but this time only a nighttime dose, per sleep medicine and psychiatry recommendation. While this brought some temporary relief from nighttime distress, despite increasing to the highest dose for age and weight (15 mg/kg/dose), this became less effective, and he was weaned off at 22 months. He had been on iron supplementation since age 6 months and received an iron infusion at 22 months because of persistently low ferritin levels and PLMD in sleep.At 24 months, X was briefly trialed on levetiracetam. While no evidence for seizures on EEG was present, this medication was chosen for involuntary movements and genetic risk for seizures. However, this medication was not useful. At 25 months, an evaluation with a movement disorder physiatrist resulted in a diagnosis of nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia, and he was started on baclofen, which has provided some, but not complete relief to nighttime symptoms. Parents are reporting he has more ""good nights"" than ""bad nights,"" but ""bad nights"" come in stretches of a few days in length with no known trigger or relief.Most recently, X was evaluated by general genetics. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was pursued which revealed a pathogenic de novo variant in FBXO11 and provides a likely cause for his neurodevelopmental phenotype. However, he has some features not explained by FBX011; thus, reanalysis of his WES was performed and revealed a de novo variant of uncertain significance in RAF1. Because pathogenic variants in RAF1 have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and Noonan spectrum disorder, it was recommended that X be followed periodically in a cardiac genetics clinic. Family is well connected into the FBXO11 community, including supportive Facebook groups. Parents have shared that they do not feel X's breathing issues and pain fit with the phenotype of other children with FBXO11 mutations.X is also enrolled in a medical child care program to facilitate development and social-emotional functioning and receives learning, speech, occupational, physical, and feeding therapy while in attendance. Despite periods of absence due to contracting numerous viral illnesses over the past several months, X continues to make progress across developmental therapies and happily engages when at the program.What additional diagnostic tests and treatment should be considered to better understand X's medical and behavioral presentation? What are the implications of chronic sleep deprivation and stress on the behavior and development of infant with X's profile? What are important psychosocial considerations because it relates to children with medical complexity (CMC), particularly for X and his family to support caregiver, family, and X's quality of life and overall well-being?",,"[{'lastname': 'Gleason', 'firstname': 'Erica', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Colorado Medicine, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO.""}, {'lastname': 'Malik', 'firstname': 'Kristina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, KidStreet & Special Care Clinic, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO.""}, {'lastname': 'Sannar', 'firstname': 'Elise', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Colorado Medicine, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO.""}, {'lastname': 'Kamara', 'firstname': 'Dana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Pulmonary & Sleep Medicine, University of Colorado Medicine, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO.""}, {'lastname': 'Serrano', 'firstname': 'Verenea', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Psychiatry, University of Colorado Medicine, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO.""}, {'lastname': 'Augustyn', 'firstname': 'Marilyn', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Boston University, Boston, MA.'}]"

The association between LPS serum levels and the asthma is not well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the LPS serum levels and the severity of asthma, demographic data and laboratory parameters.
The study included 67 patients aged >18 years with a diagnosis of asthma, and 15 healthy volunteers with no history of chronic disease as a control group. The Asthma Control Test (ACT), Respiratory Function Tests (RFTs), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and endotoxin levels were measured and compared between the groups. The endotoxin measurements were performed using the ELISA method.

38289059,"Factors associated with sensitisation to selected aero-allergens in children and adolescents with asthma followed up at Laquintinie Hospital Douala, Cameroon.",2024-01-30,"In spite of the substantial impact of pediatric asthma on healthcare resources, there is a notable dearth of research focusing on allergen sensitization specifically in children and adolescents with asthma in Cameroon, with existing studies primarily concentrating on adult populations. We, therefore, set out to determine factors associated with sensitization to selected aero-allergens in children and adolescents with asthma followed up at Laquintinie Hospital Douala, Cameroon.
We conducted a cross-sectional analytical study on patients aged 2-17 years followed up for pediatric asthma at Laquintinie Hospital Douala for 8 months (January to August 2023). Skin prick tests were performed using selected standardized aeroallergens extracts. Factors associated with sensitization were determined using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The threshold for significance was set at p < .05.
In total, 126 children and adolescents with asthma were recruited, 50.79% of whom were male with an average age of 8.00 ± 3.99 years. Eight out of 10 patients (83.52%) were sensitized to common aero-allergens (20.59% monosensitized and 79.41% polysensitized). The most common aero-allergens found were the dust mites Dermatophagoïdes pteronyssinus (81.37%), Blomia tropicalis (67.64%) and Dermatophagoïdes farinae (52.94%) followed by Blatella species (25.49%). The factors independently associated with sensitization in our population were the personal history of allergic rhinitis in the patient [adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 4.07 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.41-11.76), b = 0.54, p = .009], chest tightness at rest [aOR: 5.92 (95% CI: 1.08-32.38), b = 0.87, p = .040), and age above 5 years [aOR: 4.65 (95% CI: 1.47-14.69), b = 0.59, p = .009).
Sensitization to multiple aeroallergens is common in children and adolescents with asthma, especially for dust mites and cockroaches. Factors associated with sensitization are patients aged >5 years, chest tightness at rest, and a personal history of allergic rhinitis.","Sensitization to multiple aeroallergens is common in children and adolescents with asthma, especially for dust mites and cockroaches.

38288811,Insights from Overviewing Selective International Guidelines for Pediatric Asthma.,2024-01-30,"Asthma is a chronic atopic and inflammatory bronchial disease characterized by recurring symptoms and, episodic reversible bronchial obstruction and easily triggered bronchospasms. Asthma often begins in childhood. International guidelines are widely accepted and implemented; however, there are similarities and differences in the management approaches. There is no national guideline in many cities in Asia. This review aims to provide a practical perspective on current recommendations in the management of childhood asthma, specifically in the following aspects: diagnosis, classification of severity, treatment options, and asthma control, and to provide physicians with up-to-date information for the management of asthma.
We used the PubMed function of Clinical Queries and searched keywords of ""Asthma"", ""Pediatric,"" AND ""Guidelines"" as the search engine. ""Clinical Prediction Guides"", ""Etiology"", ""Diagnosis"", ""Therapy,"" ""Prognosis,"" and ""Narrow"" scope were used as filters. The search was conducted in November 2022. The information retrieved from this search was used in compiling the present article.
Diagnosis is clinically based on symptom pattern, response to therapy with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids, and spirometric pulmonary function testing (PFT). Asthma is classified in accordance with symptom frequency, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), atopic versus nonatopic etiology, where atopy means a predisposition toward a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. Asthma is also classified as intermittent or persistent (mild to severe). Unfortunately, there is no disease cure for asthma. However, symptoms can be prevented by trigger avoidance and suppressed with inhaled corticosteroids. Antileukotriene agents or long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) may be used together with inhaled corticosteroids if symptoms of asthma are not controlled. Rapidly worsening symptoms are usually treated with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA, e.g., salbutamol) and oral corticosteroids. Intravenous corticosteroids and hospitalization are required in severe cases of asthma attacks. Some guidelines also provide recommendations on the use of biologics and immunotherapy.
Asthma is diagnosed clinically, with supporting laboratory testing. Treatment is based on severity classification, from intermittent to persistent. Inhaled bronchodilator and steroid anti-inflammatory form the main stay of management.","Asthma is diagnosed clinically, with supporting laboratory testing.

38288585,Food Insecurity and Psychosocial Burden in a National Community-Based Sample of Households Managing Food Allergy.,2024-01-30,"Experiencing food allergies and food insecurity has been linked to socioeconomic, physical, and mental health-related challenges, but less is known about the intersection of these experiences. This study aims to better understand the impact of food insecurity on food allergy patients and their caregivers, with the intention of informing ongoing efforts to improve screening for food insecurity and mental health concerns and reducing their burden among households managing food allergy.
As part of a community needs assessment, a cross-sectional survey was administered to a large, national sample (N=5,940) of US households with at least one food-allergic individual, The Hunger Vital Sign was utilized to assess food insecurity, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) and Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) were leveraged to measure psychosocial outcomes.
Among respondents, 69.9% screened at-risk of food insecurity on the Hunger Vital Sign, while 5.6% reported very low food security. Both adults and children with food allergy (FA) from households at risk for food insecurity were more likely to report FA-related anxiety, anger, loneliness, fear of eating, and bullying victimization than their counterparts from households not at risk of food insecurity (p < .0001 for all). Among these specific experiences, FA-related anxiety was the most common (25.4%/30.1% of children/adults). Perceived risk of food allergy-related fatality was positively associated with food insecurity status.
Individuals with food allergies who are concomitantly experiencing food insecurity are at greater risk of a variety of mental health concerns, including those specific to food allergy as well as more general anxiety and depressive symptoms.","Individuals with food allergies who are concomitantly experiencing food insecurity are at greater risk of a variety of mental health concerns, including those specific to food allergy as well as more general anxiety and depressive symptoms.","[{'lastname': 'Sansweet', 'firstname': 'Samantha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Food Allergy & Asthma Research, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Roach', 'firstname': 'Anita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Food Allergy Research & Education, McLean, VA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pappalardo', 'firstname': 'Andrea A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yost', 'firstname': 'Jennaveve C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Food Allergy Research & Education, McLean, VA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Asante', 'firstname': 'Justine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'South Ward Promise Neighborhood, Newark, NJ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Warren', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Center for Food Allergy & Asthma Research, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}]"
38288460,Pulmonary Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Mimicking Asthma-Like Symptoms: A Case Report and Literature Review.,2024-01-30,"Pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinoma (PACC) is a rare, low-grade malignant salivary gland-type tumor characterized by a dormant onset and slow progression, often leading to misdiagnosis. Due to its rarity, limited cases have been reported in the literature. This report aimed to enhance clinicians' understanding of this infrequent disease.
We present the case of a 41-year-old female patient diagnosed with PACC. Our report provides a comprehensive analysis of the patient's imaging, pathology, and treatment, with a particular focus on immunohistochemical results. Importantly, we emphasize the significance of considering foreign bodies and tumors in the bronchus when encountering asthma-like symptoms unresponsive to conventional treatments. Due to the uncertain etiology and pathophysiology of PACC, there are currently no established guidelines for chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
PACC predominantly manifests as bronchial lesions without significant clinical heterogeneity. Therefore, it is crucial to consider foreign bodies and tumors in the bronchus when dealing with asthma-like symptoms, especially in patients without chronic lung disease who do not respond to anti-infective, antispasmodic, and antiasthmatic treatments. Additionally, meticulous examination of lesions is essential for timely diagnosis and intervention, ultimately improving patient survival rates.","PACC predominantly manifests as bronchial lesions without significant clinical heterogeneity.

This retrospective study analyzed hospital admissions of children and adolescents with acute asthma attacks between January 2016 and December 2021. Inclusion criteria were used to identify eligible cases, and demographic information and disease characteristics were collected. Patients were categorized into respiratory failure group and the other group based on the result of artery blood gas analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to investigate the risk factors associated with respiratory failure resulting from acute asthma attacks. The data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0, and significance was considered at 
Our research involved 225 participants, with 18.7% diagnosed with respiratory failure. The respiratory failure group was found to be younger and have higher percentage of male, while birth weight, nationality, and type of residence did not differ between the two groups. In the respiratory failure group, a significant difference was observed in emergency hospitalization, ICU treatment, severe to critical attack, dyspnea and allergy history. The two groups did not differ in admission season, first asthma diagnosis, respiratory infection and comorbidity. The respiratory failure group exhibited a higher proportion of atopy-only asthma and a lower proportion of T2-high asthma. The eosinophil count, and eosinophil percentage were lower in the respiratory failure group, while neutrophil count was higher. Having a history of allergies (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.08-5.59) and neutrophil count (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00-1.21) were the risk factors for respiratory failure in children with asthma. There also existed that the risk of respiratory failure increases with decreasing age of the children (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73-0.99).
Notably, risk factors for respiratory failure in hospitalized asthma children include age, having a history of allergies, and neutrophil count. The identification of the above factors and the implementation of timely intervention can optimize the treatment of asthma in children.","Notably, risk factors for respiratory failure in hospitalized asthma children include age, having a history of allergies, and neutrophil count.

38288208,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception of Parents in the Najran Region Toward the Use of Herbal Medicine in the Treatment of Asthma in Their Children.",2024-01-30,"Asthma is a prevalent and persistent condition affecting the respiratory system, defined by the presence of fluctuating and reversible symptoms associated with the restriction of airflow, heightened sensitivity of the bronchial tubes, and inflammation within the airways. Saudi Arabia has a high prevalence of this chronic illness, making it one of the most often seen conditions in the country. A popular therapeutic approach within the realm of complementary and alternative medicine for individuals with asthma is the use of herbal medications. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these medicines in treating asthma is often supported by inadequate data.
This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and perception of parents toward the use of herbal medicines in the treatment of asthma in their children in the Najran Region.
In this cross-sectional study, the participants received an electronic self-administered survey via social media channels. The survey instrument comprises a set of questions that have been gathered from prior studies that have comparable research aims. The questionnaire sheet will contain three parts. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22 (Released 2013; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). The sample and outcome variables were summarized using the descriptive statistics of frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. Data were analyzed by type of provider as appropriate, and the Pearson chi-square test was used to compare the observed data; the paired sample t-test was used to test the difference between the means of the pretest and post-test.
Fifteen percent of the respondents personally suffer from asthma, while 85.0% do not. Additionally, 25.7% of the respondents indicated that one of their children suffers from asthma, while 74.3% stated that their children do not suffer from asthma. The data also show that the statement ""Asthma symptoms are dry cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing"" received a 51.4% ""Strongly Agree"" response, 37.9% ""Agree,"" 9.3% ""Neutral,"" 0.9% ""Disagree,"" and 0.5% ""Strongly Disagree."" The majority of respondents (51.4%) reported obtaining information about asthma from doctors. A notable portion of respondents (35.5%) reported using herbs or folk medicines to treat asthma in their children. A substantial portion of respondents (44.9%) reported not using medicinal herbs at all. Despite this, 41.6% of respondents expressed belief in the idea of taking herbs as a treatment.
In conclusion, the knowledge, attitude, and perception of parents toward the use of herbal medicine in the treatment of asthma in their children are multifaceted and influenced by cultural, social, and individual factors. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing culturally sensitive healthcare interventions and policies that align with the beliefs and practices of the community.","In conclusion, the knowledge, attitude, and perception of parents toward the use of herbal medicine in the treatment of asthma in their children are multifaceted and influenced by cultural, social, and individual factors.

Particulate matter, specifically the fine-grain desert sand found in the Middle East, may be a key source of this pathology because of deleterious effects on mucociliary clearance.
With IRB approval, human sinonasal tissue was grown at an air-liquid interface and cultures were exposed to different types and sizes of particulate matter, including sand from Afghanistan and Kuwait. Ciliary dynamic responses to mechanical stimulation and ATP application were assessed following particulate exposure.
Particle size of the commercial sand was substantially larger than that of the sand of Afghan or Kuwaiti origin. Following exposure to particulate matter, normal dynamic ciliary responses to mechanical stimulation and ATP application were significantly decreased (P < .01), with corresponding decreases in ATP-induced calcium flux (P < .05). These changes were partially reversible with apical washing after a 16-h period of exposure. After 36 h of exposure to Middle Eastern sand, ciliary responses to purinergic stimulation were completely abolished.
There is a neutralization of the dynamic ciliary response following chronic particulate matter exposure, similar to ciliary pathologies observed in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

38287757,Appendectomy and asthma: a search for an association in older subjects.,2024-01-30,"Several risk factors found to be associated with postoperative complications and cancer surgery, which carry a significant morbidity risk to cancer patients. Therefore, prehabilitation is necessary to improve the functional capability and nutritional status of a patient prior to surgery, so that the patient can withstand any postoperative activity and associated deterioration. Thus, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of prehabilitation interventions on the functional status of patients with gastric and oesophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy and gastrectomy.
An interventional study was carried out among oesophageal and gastric cancer patients who had undergone surgery at the National Cancer Institute of Malaysia. The prehabilitation process took a maximum of two weeks, depending on the patient's optimisation before surgery. The prehabilitation is based on functional capacity (ECOG performance status), muscle function (handgrip strength), cardio-respiratory function (peak flow meter) and nutritional status (calorie and protein). Postoperative outcomes are measured based on the length of hospital stay, complications, and Clavien-Dindo Classification.
Thirty-one patients were recruited to undergo a prehabilitation intervention prior to gastrectomy (n=21) and esophagectomy (n=10). Demographically, most of the cancer patients were males (67.7%) with an ideal mean of BMI (23.5±6.0). Physically, the majority of them had physical class (ASA grade) Grade 2 (67.7%), ECOG performance status of 1 (61.3%) and SGA grade B (51.6%). The functional capacity and nutritional status showed a significant improvement after one week of prehabilitation interventions: peak expiratory flow meter (p<0.001), handgrip (p<0.001), ECOG performance (p<0.001), walking distance (p<0.001), incentive spirometry (p<0.001), total body calorie (p<0.001) and total body protein (p=0.004). However, those patients who required two weeks of prehabilitation for optimization showed only significant improvement in peak expiratory flow meter (p<0.001), handgrip (p<0.001), and incentive spirometry (p<0.001). Prehabilitation is significantly associated postoperatively with the length of hospital stay (p=0.028), complications (p=0.011) and Clavien-Dindo Classification (p=0.029).

Targeting PDE4A with novel therapeutic agents shows promise in addressing neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), mood disorders (depression, anxiety), inflammatory conditions (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and even cancer. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that integrates virtual screening and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify potential inhibitors of PDE4A from the existing pool of FDA-approved drugs. The initial compound selection was conducted focusing on binding affinity scores, which led to the identification of several high-affinity compounds with potential PDE4A binding properties. From the refined selection process, two promising compounds, Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine, emerged as strong candidates, displaying substantial affinity and specificity for the PDE4A binding site. Interaction analysis provided robust evidence of their binding capabilities. To gain deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine in complex with PDE4A, we conducted 300 ns MD simulations, principal components analysis (PCA), and free energy landscape (FEL) analysis. These analyses revealed that Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine binding stabilized the PDE4A structure and induced minimal conformational changes, highlighting their potential as potent binders. In conclusion, our study systematically explores repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs as PDE4A inhibitors through a comprehensive virtual screening pipeline. The identified compounds, Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine, exhibit a strong affinity for PDE4A, displaying characteristics that support their suitability for further development as potential therapeutic agents for conditions associated with PDE4A dysfunction.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

38287428,Using healthcare systems data for outcomes in clinical trials: issues to consider at the design stage.,2024-01-30,"Healthcare system data (HSD) are increasingly used in clinical trials, augmenting or replacing traditional methods of collecting outcome data. This study, PRIMORANT, set out to identify, in the UK context, issues to be considered before the decision to use HSD for outcome data in a clinical trial is finalised, a methodological question prioritised by the clinical trials community.
The PRIMORANT study had three phases. First, an initial workshop was held to scope the issues faced by trialists when considering whether to use HSDs for trial outcomes. Second, a consultation exercise was undertaken with clinical trials unit (CTU) staff, trialists, methodologists, clinicians, funding panels and data providers. Third, a final discussion workshop was held, at which the results of the consultation were fed back, case studies presented, and issues considered in small breakout groups.
Key topics included in the consultation process were the validity of outcome data, timeliness of data capture, internal pilots, data-sharing, practical issues, and decision-making. A majority of consultation respondents (n = 78, 95%) considered the development of guidance for trialists to be feasible. Guidance was developed following the discussion workshop, for the five broad areas of terminology, feasibility, internal pilots, onward data sharing, and data archiving.
We provide guidance to inform decisions about whether or not to use HSDs for outcomes, and if so, to assist trialists in working with registries and other HSD providers to improve the design and delivery of trials.",,"[{'lastname': 'Toader', 'firstname': 'Alice-Maria', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'MRC-NIHR Trials Methodology Research Partnership, Department of Health Data Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.

38287280,Analysis of the correlation between serum Klotho and FeNO: a cross-sectional study from NHANES (2007-2012).,2024-01-30,"Klotho is an anti-aging protein that has multiple functions and may play a key role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) is a non-invasive and novel biomarker that has the advantages of being simple, fast and reproducible. It can effectively assess the degree of airway inflammation in diseases such as asthma and COPD. Despite these insights, the relationship between serum Klotho levels and FeNO has not been explored yet.
Leveraging data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2007 to 2012, we investigated the correlation between FeNO and serum Klotho levels. This association was scrutinized both as continuous variables and within quartile distributions, utilizing the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The correlation between the two variables was assessed through Spearman rank analysis. Employing survey weight-adjusted linear regression models, we gauged the strength of these associations.
This study included 6,527 participants with a median FeNO level of 14.5 parts per billion (ppb). We found that FeNO levels varied significantly across different quartiles of Klotho protein (H = 7.985, P = 0.046). We also found a significant positive correlation between serum Klotho levels and FeNO levels in the whole population (Spearman's rho = 0.029, P = 0.019). This correlation remained significant after adjusting for covariates such as age, gender, lung function, smoking status, alcohol use, BMI, cardiovascular disease (including hypertension, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction), diabetes, inflammatory markers, serum vitamin D level and BUN (P < 0.05 for all). Furthermore, this correlation was stronger at the high (K3) and super high (K4) levels of Klotho than at the low (K1) and medium (K2) levels (β = 1.979 ppb and β = 1.993 ppb for K3 and K4 vs. K1, respectively; 95% CI: 0.497 ~ 2.953 and 95% CI: 0.129 ~ 2.827, respectively; P = 0.007 and P = 0.032, respectively). The β coefficient for serum Klotho was 0.002 ppb/pg/ml.
Our study illuminates a positive correlation between serum Klotho levels and FeNO.

38287095,Effect of chronic lung diseases on angina pectoris among Indian adults: longitudinal ageing study in India.,2024-01-30,"The study aimed to evaluate the effect of chronic lung diseases, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and asthma, on angina pectoris in individuals aged 45 years and above. Identifying vulnerable subpopulations suffering from COPD and asthma at higher risk of future cardiovascular events using the rose angina questionnaire is imperative for tailored primary and secondary prevention approaches. The present study utilizes the data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India, wave 1, conducted during 2017-2018. The sample size included 58,830 individuals aged 45 years and above. Angina was measured based on seven questions from Rose's questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis were employed to examine the prevalence of angina among individuals with COPD and asthma. Further, multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) methods were used to assess the independent effect of COPD and asthma on angina after controlling the selected background characteristics. We employed PSM in two different models and included various additional factors in model 2, such as smoking, chewing tobacco, alcohol use, ADL, IADL, body mass index, physical activity, high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic heart disease. The current study shows that the prevalence of angina pectoris, COPD and asthma was 6.0%, 2.3% and 4.7%, respectively, among individuals aged 45 years and above in India. The prevalence of angina pectoris was higher among individuals with COPD (9.6% vs. 5.8%) and asthma (9.9% vs. 5.7%) than those without COPD and asthma, respectively. Additionally, angina pectoris was more prevalent among females and rural respondents with COPD (10.8% and 11.0%) and asthma (10.3% and 10.3%) compared to males and urban respondents with COPD (8.0% and 5.7%) and asthma (8.9% and 7.9%). Moreover, in the adjusted model, individuals with COPD (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03 1.98) and asthma (AOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.17 1.77) had nearly 1.5-fold higher odds of having angina pectoris than those without COPD and asthma. The PSM estimates showed that individuals with COPD had 8.4% and 5.0% increased risk of angina pectoris compared to those without COPD in model 1 and model 2, respectively. We observed that, after adjusting to lifestyle, health-related and morbidity factors in model 2, both average treatment effect on untreated (ATU) and average treatment effect (ATE) values decreased by nearly 3.5%. Additionally, the PSM estimates demonstrated that individuals with asthma had a 3.4% and 2.9% increased risk of angina pectoris compared to those without asthma in model 1 and model 2, respectively. The study suggests that COPD and asthma are significantly associated with angina pectoris, and individuals with COPD and asthma have a higher risk of developing angina pectoris. Additionally, angina pectoris was more prevalent among females, rural respondents and adults aged 45-54 with COPD compared to males, urban respondents and those aged 65 and above, respectively, with COPD. Moreover, the findings of our study underscore the targeted primary and secondary interventions and team-based care approach among individuals with COPD and asthma to reduce the risk of CVD events in future.",,"[{'lastname': 'Ahmed', 'firstname': 'Waquar', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Systems Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India. waquar8219@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Dixit', 'firstname': 'Priyanka', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Systems Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India.'}]"
38286962,Can the Evidence-Based Use of Probiotics (Notably Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) Mitigate the Clinical Effects of Antibiotic-Associated Dysbiosis?,2024-01-30,"Dysbiosis corresponds to the disruption of a formerly stable, functionally complete microbiota. In the gut, this imbalance can lead to adverse health outcomes in both the short and long terms, with a potential increase in the lifetime risks of various noncommunicable diseases and disorders such as atopy (like asthma), inflammatory bowel disease, neurological disorders, and even behavioural and psychological disorders. Although antibiotics are highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in infectious diseases, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common, non-negligible clinical sign of gut dysbiosis (and the only visible one). Re-establishment of a normal (functional) gut microbiota is promoted by completion of the clinically indicated course of antibiotics, the removal of any other perturbing external factors, the passage of time (i.e. recovery through the microbiota's natural resilience), appropriate nutritional support, and-in selected cases-the addition of probiotics. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials have confirmed the strain-specific efficacy of some probiotics (notably the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 and the bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) in the treatment and/or prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children and in adults. Unusually for a probiotic, S. boulardii is a eukaryote and is not therefore directly affected by antibiotics-making it suitable for administration in cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. A robust body of evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses shows that the timely administration of an adequately dosed probiotic (upon initiation of antibiotic treatment or within 48 h) can help to prevent or resolve the consequences of antibiotic-associated dysbiosis (such as diarrhoea) and promote the resilience of the gut microbiota and a return to the pre-antibiotic state. A focus on the prescription of evidence-based, adequately dosed probiotics should help to limit unjustified and potentially ineffective self-medication.",,"[{'lastname': 'Waitzberg', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, LIM-35, School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Guarner', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Teknon Medical Centre, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Hojsak', 'firstname': 'Iva', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Referral Centre for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.\nUniversity of Zagreb Medical School, Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ianiro', 'firstname': 'Gianluca', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Translational Medicine and Surgery, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.\nDepartment of Medical and Surgical Sciences, UOC Gastroenterologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy.\nDepartment of Medical and Surgical Sciences, UOC CEMAD Centro Malattie Dell'Apparato Digerente, Medicina Interna e Gastroenterologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Polk', 'firstname': 'D Brent', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': ""Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, San Diego, and Rady Children's Hospital, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Sokol', 'firstname': 'Harry', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Gastroenterology Department, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, CRSA, AP-HP, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75571, Paris Cedex 12, France. harry.sokol@gmail.com.\nUniversité Paris-Saclay, INRAe, AgroParisTech, Micalis Institute, Jouy-en-Josas, France. harry.sokol@gmail.com.\nParis Center for Microbiome Medicine (PaCeMM) FHU, Paris, France. harry.sokol@gmail.com.'}]"

38286741,Anti-inflammatory effects of reticuline on the JAK2/STAT3/SOCS3 and p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway in a mouse model of obesity-associated asthma.,2024-01-30,"Asthma associated with obesity is a chronic disease characterized by earlier airway remodeling, severe wheezing, and increased insensitivity to hormone therapy. Reticuline, a bioactive compound of Magnoliae Flos, exerts anti-inflammatory activity and can inhibit neutrophil recruitment. Thus, this study investigated the role of reticuline in obesity-related asthma.
The BALB/c mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD) were intranasally challenged with house dust mites (HDMs) or ovalbumin (OVA). Reticuline (0.25 mg/kg) was administrated into mice by intragastrical gavage. Airway hyper-responsiveness was examined after the final challenge. Body weight was measured, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected. The number of inflammatory cells in BALF was estimated. Histological changes were assessed by performing hematoxylin-eosin staining, and production of proinflammatory cytokines and IgE was examined by ELISA kits. Related pathways were studied with western blotting.
Reticuline suppressed airway resistance and inflammatory infiltration in lung tissue and reduced inflammatory cell recruitment in BALF in obesity mice with asthma. Additionally, the levels of IL-17A, IL-1β, IL-5, macrophage inflammatory protein 2, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted in the lung were reduced by reticuline. Mechanistically, reticuline inactivated the JAK2/STAT3/SOCS3 and p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways in obesity-related asthma.

38286408,Are Questionnaires Helpful To Predict Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) And Exercise-Induced Laryngeal Obstruction (EILO)?,2024-01-30,"Exercise induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO) is an important differential diagnosis to exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and diagnosed via continuous laryngoscopy while exercising (CLE). However, availability of CLE is limited to specialized centres. And without CLE EILO is often misdiagnosed as EIB. Therefore it is essential to carefully preselect potential EILO candidates. Aim of this study was to investigate whether two short questionnaires -Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Dyspnea Index (DI) evaluating upper airway-related dyspnea- can differentiate between EIB and EILO.
Patients with dyspnea while exercising were analysed with an exercise challenge in the cold chamber (ECC) to diagnose EIB in visit 1 (V1), as appropriate a CLE in visit 2 (V2, 4-6 weeks after V1) and ACT and DI in V1 and V2. EIB patients were treated with asthma medication after V1.
Complete dataset of 36 subjects were gathered. The ACT showed lower values in V2 in EILO compared to EIB patients. A lack of improvement in ACT in V2 after asthma medication of EIB patients is suspicious for additional EILO diagnosis. The DI showed higher values in V1 in EILO compared to EIB patients. A score≥30 can predict a positive CLE reaction.
ACT and DI are valuable tools in preselecting CLE candidates to assure timely diagnostic despite limited diagnostic capabilities.
Belastungsinduzierte Larynxobstruktion (EILO) ist eine wichtige Differentialdiagnose zur belastungsinduzierten Bronchokonstriktion (EIB) und wird mittels kontinuierlicher Laryngoskopie unter Belastung (CLE) diagnostiziert. Die Verfügbarkeit der CLE ist jedoch auf spezialisierte Zentren limitiert und ohne CLE wird EILO häufig als EIB fehldiagnostiziert. Deshalb ist eine gute Vorauswahl potentieller EILO Kandidaten essentiell. Das Ziel der Studie war die Analyse ob zwei kurze Fragebögen – Asthma Control Test (ACT) und Dyspnea Index (DI) der obere Atemwegsdyspnoe evaluiert – zwischen EIB und EILO differenzieren können.
Patienten mit belastungsinduzierter Dyspnoe wurden mittels Kältelaufbelastung (ECC) in Visite 1 (V1), wenn indiziert einer CLE in Visite 2 (V2, 4–6 Wochen nach V1) sowie ACT und DI in V1 und V2 untersucht. EIB Patienten erhielten nach V1 eine Asthmatherapie.
Vollständige Datensätze zu 36 Patienten wurden erhoben. Der ACT zeigte in V2 niedrigere Werte in EILO als in EIB Patienten. Eine fehlende Verbesserung des ACT in V2 nach Asthmatherapie der EIB Patienten ist hinweisend auf eine zusätzliche EILO Diagnose. Der DI zeigte in V1 höhere Werte in EILO als in EIB Patienten. Ein Score≥30 sagte eine EILO-Reaktion in der CLE vorher.

Subjects with positive bronchial provocation testing were classified as the CTVA group, while those with negative results served as the non-CTVA control group.
The lung function of children in both groups was normal. The FeNO level in the CTVA group was (22.35 ± 9.91) ppb, significantly higher than the control group (14.85 ± 5.63) ppb, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The value of FeNO in diagnosing CTVA was analyzed using an ROC curve, with an area under the curve of 0.073 (P < 0.05). The optimal cutoff point for diagnosing CTVA using FeNO was determined to be 18.5 ppb, with a sensitivity of 60.3 % and specificity of 77.8 %. There was a negative correlation between FeNO and Dmin as well as PD15 (P = 0.006).
FeNO can serve as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for CTVA, with the optimal cutoff point for diagnosing CTVA being 18.5 ppb. However, FeNO is not a specific diagnostic marker for CTVA and should be used in conjunction with bronchial provocation testing to enhance its diagnostic value.","FeNO can serve as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for CTVA, with the optimal cutoff point for diagnosing CTVA being 18.5 ppb.

38285673,Development and evaluation of a computerized algorithm for the interpretation of pulmonary function tests.,2024-01-29,"Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are usually interpreted by clinicians using rule-based strategies and pattern recognition. The interpretation, however, has variabilities due to patient and interpreter errors. Most PFTs have recognizable patterns that can be categorized into specific physiological defects. In this study, we developed a computerized algorithm using the python package (pdfplumber) and validated against clinicians' interpretation. We downloaded PFT reports in the electronic medical record system that were in PDF format. We digitized the flow volume loop (FVL) and extracted numeric values from the reports. The algorithm used FEV1/FVC<0.7 for obstruction, TLC<80%pred for restriction and <80% or >120%pred for abnormal DLCO. The algorithm also used a small airway disease index (SADI) to quantify late expiratory flattening of the FVL to assess small airway dysfunction. We devised keywords for the python Natural Language Processing (NLP) package (spaCy) to identify obstruction, restriction, abnormal DLCO and small airway dysfunction in the reports. The algorithm was compared to clinicians' interpretation in 6,889 PFTs done between March 1st, 2018, and September 30th, 2020. The agreement rates (Cohen's kappa) for obstruction, restriction and abnormal DLCO were 94.4% (0.868), 99.0% (0.979) and 87.9% (0.750) respectively. In 4,711 PFTs with FEV1/FVC≥0.7, the algorithm identified 190 tests with SADI < lower limit of normal (LLN), suggesting small airway dysfunction. Of these, the clinicians (67.9%) also flagged 129 tests. When SADI was ≥ LLN, no clinician's reports indicated small airway dysfunction. Our results showed the computerized algorithm agreed with clinicians' interpretation in approximately 90% of the tests and provided a sensitive objective measure for assessing small airway dysfunction. The algorithm can improve efficiency and consistency and decrease human errors in PFT interpretation. The computerized algorithm works directly on PFT reports in PDF format and can be adapted to incorporate a different interpretation strategy and platform.",,"[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yuh-Chin T', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Henriquez', 'firstname': 'Luke', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cognitive Science, Case Western University, Cleveland, OH, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hengji', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Henriquez', 'firstname': 'Craig', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America.'}]"
38285123,A Comprehensive Metagenome Study Identifies Distinct Biological Pathways in Asthma Patients: An In-Silico Approach.,2024-01-29,"Asthma is a multifactorial disease with phenotypes and several clinical and pathophysiological characteristics. Besides innate and adaptive immune responses, the gut microbiome generates Treg cells, mediating the allergic response to environmental factors and exposure to allergens. Because of the complexity of asthma, microbiome analysis and other precision medicine methods are now widely regarded as essential elements of efficient disease therapy. An in-silico pipeline enables the comparative taxonomic profiling of 16S rRNA metagenomic profiles of 20 asthmatic patients and 15 healthy controls utilizing QIIME2. Further, PICRUSt supports downstream gene enrichment and pathway analysis, inferring the enriched pathways in a diseased state. A significant abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria, Sutterella, and Megamonas is identified in asthma patients and a diminished genus Akkermansia. Nasal samples reveal a high relative abundance of Mycoplasma in the nasal samples. Further, differential functional profiling identifies the metabolic pathways related to cofactors and amino acids, secondary metabolism, and signaling pathways.

38284920,Effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy in pediatric cedar pollinosis: A real-world database study.,2024-01-29,"Pediatric allergic rhinitis (AR), including cedar pollinosis (CP), is increasing in Japan. We investigated the effects of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), which has limited studies of its effectiveness in real-world settings, on children with CP.
This retrospective cohort study used a claim database in 2018-2021. Children aged ≤15 years with CP records in 2019 were eligible and were followed up through 2021. We included 2962 CP children undergoing SLIT and 547 who were not. The medication score was used to evaluate SLIT effectiveness in the cedar pollen dispersal season each year. Adverse events and the occurrence of allergic diseases were also evaluated.
Medication score was higher in the SLIT group during the index period but lower in 2021 compared to the non-SLIT group (mean ± standard deviation: 5.17 ± 2.39 and 4.74 ± 2.38 in 2019, 3.13 ± 2.30 and 3.55 ± 2.48 in 2021, respectively). The adjusted mean difference between groups from 2019 to 2021 was -0.62 (95% confidence interval: -0.86 to -0.39, p < .0001), and the medication score was reduced in the SLIT group (risk ratio: 1.2: 1.1 to 1.3). The occurrence of adverse events involving abdominal disorders (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.64: 0.51 to 0.81), asthma exacerbation (aOR: 0.37: 0.24 to 0.57), and allergic diseases involving hay fever unrelated to CP (aOR: 0.60: 0.45 to 0.80) or asthma (aOR: 0.71: 0.58 to 0.86) was lower in the SLIT group.

38284918,Genetics of preschool wheeze and its progression to childhood asthma.,2024-01-29,"Wheezing is a common and heterogeneous condition in preschool children. In some countries, the prevalence can be as high as 30% and up to 50% of all children experience wheezing before the age of 6. Asthma often starts with preschool wheeze, but not all wheezing children will develop asthma at school age. At this moment, it is not possible to accurately predict which wheezing children will develop asthma. Recently, studying the genetics of wheeze and the childhood-onset of asthma have grown in interest. Childhood-onset asthma has a stronger heritability in comparison with adult-onset asthma. In early childhood asthma exacerbations, CDHR3, which encodes the receptor for Rhinovirus C, was identified, as well as IL33, and the 17q locus that includes GSDMB and ORMDL3 genes. The 17q locus is the strongest wheeze and childhood-onset asthma locus, and was shown to interact with many environmental factors, including smoking and infections. Finally, ANXA1 was recently associated with early-onset, persistent wheeze. ANXA1 may help resolve eosinophilic inflammation. Overall, despite its complexities, genetic approaches to unravel the early-onset of wheeze and asthma are promising, since these shed more light on mechanisms of childhood asthma-onset. Implicated genes point toward airway epithelium and its response to external factors, such as viral infections. However, the heterogeneity of wheeze phenotypes complicates genetic studies. It is therefore important to define accurate wheezing phenotypes and forge larger international collaborations to gain a better understanding of the pathways underlying early-onset asthma.",,"[{'lastname': 'Wolters', 'firstname': 'Alba A B', 'initials': 'AAB', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Pulmonology and Pediatric Allergology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.\nGroningen Research Institute for Asthma and COPD, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""}, {'lastname': 'Kersten', 'firstname': 'Elin T G', 'initials': 'ETG', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Pulmonology and Pediatric Allergology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.\nGroningen Research Institute for Asthma and COPD, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""}, {'lastname': 'Koppelman', 'firstname': 'Gerard H', 'initials': 'GH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Pulmonology and Pediatric Allergology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.\nGroningen Research Institute for Asthma and COPD, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""}]"
38284792,Swallowed topical corticosteroids for eosinophilic esophagitis: Utilization and real-world efficacy from the EoE CONNECT registry.,2024-01-29,"Swallowed topical corticosteroids (tC) are common therapy for patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Widely heterogeneous results have occurred due to their active ingredients, formulations and doses.
To assess the effectiveness of topical corticosteroid therapy for EoE in real-world practice.
Cross-sectional study analysis of the multicentre EoE CONNECT registry. Clinical remission was defined as a decrease of ≥50% in dysphagia symptom scores; histological remission was defined as a peak eosinophil count below 15 per high-power field. The effectiveness in achieving clinico-histological remission (CHR) was compared for the main tC formulations.
Overall, data on 1456 prescriptions of tC in monotherapy used in 866 individual patients were assessed. Of those, 904 prescriptions with data on formulation were employed for the induction of remission; 234 reduced a previously effective dose for maintenance. Fluticasone propionate formulations dominated the first-line treatment, while budesonide was more common in later therapies. A swallowed nasal drop suspension was the most common formulation of fluticasone propionate. Doses ≥0.8 mg/day provided a 65% CHR rate and were superior to lower doses. Oral viscous solution prepared by a pharmacist was the most common prescription of budesonide; 4 mg/day provided no benefit over 2 mg/day (CHR rated being 72% and 80%, respectively). A multivariate analysis revealed budesonide orodispersible tablets as the most effective therapy (OR 18.9, p < 0.001); use of higher doses (OR 4.3, p = 0.03) and lower symptom scores (OR 0.9, p = 0.01) were also determinants of effectiveness.
Reduced symptom severity, use of high doses, and use of budesonide orodispersible tablets particularly were all independent predictors of tC effectiveness.","Reduced symptom severity, use of high

We compared differences in acute care utilization for asthma exacerbations among migrant and non-migrant Latino and non-Hispanic white (NHW) children at U.S. community health centers. A retrospective observational study utilizing electronic health record data from the ADVANCE Clinical Research Network of United States community health centers included 13,423 children ages 3-17 with a primary care visit between 2005 and 2017 from eight states. Emergency department (ED) and hospitalization data came from Oregon Medicaid claims. Outcomes included acute clinic visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation. Regression analyses adjusted for patient-level covariates. Latino children had higher odds of acute clinic visits for asthma exacerbation compared to NHW children (MSFW odds ratio [OR] = 1.17, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.33; without migrant status OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.23).

38283200,Preparation of Budesonide-Loaded Liposomal Nanoparticles for Pulmonary Delivery and Their Therapeutic Effect in OVA-Induced Asthma in Mice.,2024-01-29,"Inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide (BUD), are widely employed for the treatment of asthma. However, the frequent use of corticosteroids is associated with numerous adverse effects and poses challenges to ongoing drug therapy and patient adherence. Budesonide liposomal nanoparticles (BUD-LNPs) were developed to improve the bioavailability of the drug and thereby improve the effectiveness of asthma treatment.
BUD-LNPs were prepared via thin-film hydration, and the characterizations, stability, and in vitro release of BUD-LNPs were studied. In vitro cellular uptake was observed by laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and flow cytometry. And the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of BUD-LNPs was evaluated by measuring the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in activated macrophages. Besides, the accumulation time in the lung of drugs delivered via liposomal carriers and free drugs was compared in vivo. And the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of BUD-LNPs was assessed in OVA-induced asthmatic mice. Finally, in vivo biosafety assessment was performed.
The particle size, PDI, and zeta potential of BUD-LNPs were 127.63±1.33 nm, 0.27±0.02, and 3.33±0.13 mV, respectively. BUD-LNPs exhibited excellent biosafety and anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. Furthermore, compared with the free drugs, the utilization of liposomal nano-vehicles for drugs delivery could effectively extend the duration of drugs accumulation in the pulmonary system. Additionally, treatment with BUD-LNPs alleviated airway hyperresponsiveness, reduced airway mucus secretion, and mitigated pulmonary inflammation in OVA-induced asthmatic mice. And the BUD-LNPs demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy compared to free BUD.
BUD-LNPs was successfully prepared with excellent stability and sustained release for 24 h in vitro. The data of anti-inflammatory activity, asthma therapeutic effects and safety studies indicated that drug delivery mediated by liposomal nano-vehicles was a feasible and desirable strategy for medical strategy and showed great promise in the clinical therapy of asthma.","BUD-LNPs was successfully prepared with excellent stability and sustained release for 24 h in vitro.

38283085,Perspectives and gaps in the management of food allergy and anaphylaxis in the Asia-Pacific Region.,2024-01-29,"Food allergy (FA), which is a condition that has no effective cure and can result in severe life-threatening allergic reactions, remains a global public health concern; however, little is known about how FAs are currently managed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The main objective of this survey was to evaluate the epidemiology of FA, as well as the availability of resources and practices for management of FA and anaphylaxis by health care providers across Asia.
From June 2022 to September 2022, a questionnaire-based survey comprising 66 questions was electronically sent to member societies of the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma and Clinical Immunology by using Survey Monkey.
A total of 20 responses were received from 15 member countries and territories. Compared with the pediatric data, there was a lack of prevalence data for FA in adults. Except for Australia and Japan, most regions had between 0.1 and 0.5 allergists per 100,000 population and some had fewer than 0.1 allergists per 100,000 population. The perceived rate of FA in regions with a short supply of allergists was high. Although specific IgE tests and oral food challenges were available in all regions, the median wait time for oral food challenges at government facilities was 37 days (interquartile range = 10.5-60 days). Seven regions still relied on prescriptions of ampules and syringes of injectable adrenaline, and adrenaline autoinjectors were not accessible in 4 regions. Oral immunotherapy as FA treatment was available in half of the surveyed countries and territories.
Our study offers a cross-sectional evaluation of the management practices for FA in each Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma and Clinical Immunology member country or territory.

The study aimed to identify prevalent local food items and assess allergic sensitization rates to potential trigger foods for atopic diseases via skin prick and specific IgE testing.
The study began with a pilot survey of 100 subjects recruited from 4 hospitals in Hyderabad, India, focusing on foods perceived to relate to asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and gastrointestinal allergic symptoms. A subsequent main study evaluated 2010 participants, 1754 of whom were diagnosed with an aforementioned atopic disease and who reported allergic symptoms related to any of 77 foods identified in the pilot study. Ultimately 1622 patients who consented to skin prick and specific IgE testing and who reported at least 1 food item triggering allergic diseases were included in the final analysis.
Among 1622 patients (average age, 42.6 ± 12.9 years; 55.5% male), asthma was the most commonly diagnosed atopic disease (26.4%), with itching and rash being frequently reported symptoms (22.7%). Notably, 94.9% of patients had total serum IgE > 144 kU/L. Chickpea, cabbage, eggplant, walnut, cumin, and betel leaf were the most commonly reported trigger foods.

Most peripheral airway parameters were significantly increased in children with uncontrolled asthma compared with children with controlled asthma. The measures with the highest diagnostic accuracy for asthma control were lung clearance index (LCI) (AUC = 0.76), with high specificity (0.97) and modest sensitivity (0.46), acinar ventilation heterogeneity (Sacin) (AUC = 0.73), with high sensitivity (0.85) and modest specificity (0.54), and resonance frequency (Fres) (AUC= 0.74), with perfect specificity (1.0) but low sensitivity (0.38).

Discrepancies in the performance (i.e. sensitivity and specificity) of each parameter suggest that a combination may be most effective in determining asthma control status.",,"[{'lastname': 'Wawszczak', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatric Pneumonology and Allergy, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kulus', 'firstname': 'Marek', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatric Pneumonology and Allergy, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Peradzyńska', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}]"
38282201,"Suppressed pediatric asthma hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, from a national survey.",2024-01-29,"Acute asthma exacerbation in children is often caused by respiratory infections. In this study, a coordinated national surveillance system for acute asthma hospitalizations and causative respiratory infections was established. We herein report recent trends in pediatric acute asthma hospitalizations since the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.
Thirty-three sentinel hospitals in Japan registered all of their hospitalized pediatric asthma patients and their causal pathogens. The changes in acute asthma hospitalization in children before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether or not COVID-19 caused acute asthma exacerbation were investigated.
From fiscal years 2010-2019, the median number of acute asthma hospitalizations per year was 3524 (2462-4570), but in fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the numbers were 820, 1,001, and 1,026, respectively (the fiscal year in Japan is April to March). This decrease was observed in all age groups with the exception of the 3- to 6-year group. SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in 2094 patients from fiscal years 2020-2022, but the first positive case was not detected until February 2022. Since then, only 36 of them have been identified with SARS-CoV-2, none of which required mechanical ventilation. Influenza, RS virus, and human metapneumovirus infections also decreased in FY 2020. In contrast, 24% of patients had not been receiving long-term control medications before admission despite the severity of bronchial asthma.
SARS-CoV-2 was hardly detected in children with acute asthma hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 did not induce acute asthma exacerbation in children. Rather, infection control measures implemented against the pandemic may have consequently reduced other respiratory virus infections and thus acute asthma hospitalizations during this period. However, the fact that many hospitalized patients have not been receiving appropriate long-term control medications is a major problem that should be addressed.","SARS-CoV-2 was hardly detected in children with acute asthma hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic.

38282200,Bacteria and viruses and clinical outcomes of asthma-bronchiectasis overlap syndrome: A cohort study.,2024-01-29,"Despite the high prevalence of co-existing bronchiectasis and asthma (asthma-bronchiectasis overlap syndrome [ABOS]), little is known regarding the dominant pathogens and clinical correlates.
To investigate the bacteria and viruses which differentially dominate in ABOS (including its subtypes) compared with bronchiectasis alone, and determine their relevance with bronchiectasis severity and exacerbations.
This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted between March 2017 and August 2023. We included 81 patients with ABOS and 107 patients with bronchiectasis alone. At steady-state baseline, patients underwent comprehensive assessments and sputum collection for bacterial culture and viral detection (quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction). Patients were followed-up to record exacerbation and spirometry.
Patients with ABOS had significantly higher symptom burden and exacerbation frequency than those with bronchiectasis alone. Despite similar pathogen spectrum, the rate of bacteria-virus co-detection increased less substantially at acute exacerbations (AE) onset than at steady-state compared with bronchiectasis alone. Pathogenic bacteria (particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were detected fairly common (exceeding 50%) in ABOS and were associated with greater severity of bronchiectasis when stable and conferred greater exacerbation risks at follow-up. Viral but not bacterial compositions changed substantially at AE onset compared with clinical stability. Higher blood eosinophil count, moderate-to-severe bronchiectasis and non-atopy were associated with higher odds of bacterial, but not viral, detection (all p < 0.05).
Detection of bacteria or virus is associated with bronchiectasis severity or clinical outcomes in ABOS. This highlights the importance of integrating sputum microbial assessment for ascertaining the dominant pathophysiology (atopy vs. infection) and longitudinal trajectory prediction in ABOS.",Detection of bacteria or virus is associated with bronchiectasis severity or clinical outcomes in ABOS.

38282199,Assessment of the effectiveness of the peptide inhibitor homologous to the transforming growth factor β cytokine blocking the TGFβRI/TGFβRII receptor complex-pilot study.,2024-01-29,"A key player in the fibrotic process is the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) which enhances extracellular matrix production by increasing the transcription of matrix proteins. The cytokine TGF-β first binds to the TGFβRII receptor (dimer), resulting in the recruitment of the TGFβRI receptor (dimer). The complex thus formed leads to the phosphorylation of the kinase domain of TGFβRI, which in turn results in activation of the Smad pathway. This is therefore a targeted pathway for research into the application of peptide inhibitors in blocking the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to design a peptide inhibitor (homologous to the cytokine TGF-β) which, after binding to the TGFβRI/TGFβRII receptor, would block the cytokine binding and thus prevent the formation of an activating complex.
Preliminary work on the design and synthesis of inhibitors for TGFβRI/TGFβRII has allowed us to identify and describe five key regions of the TGF-β-TGFβRI/TGFβRII interface. The following five peptide inhibitors were synthesized for Region 1: 1.1 ALDAAYCFR, 1.2 LDAAYCFRN, 1.3 DAAYCFRNV, 1.4 AAYCFRNVQ, 1.5 AYCFRNVQD. The expression of the SEAP reporter gene, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and JNK1 gene was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
For Region 1 peptide inhibitors tested for TGFβRI/TGFβRII, reduced SEAP (reporter gene) expression was observed in cells of the MFB-F11 line, which suggests inhibited the formation of cytokine-receptor complexes.
For IP1_2, 1_3 and 1_5 Region 1 peptides tested for TGFβRI/TGFβRII, reduced cytokine-receptor signal by adding newly designed inhibitors. The study revealed an impact of these peptide inhibitors on the reduction of mRNA expression of Smad2, Smad3, Smad4 and JNK1 genes.",,"[{'lastname': 'Mateusz', 'firstname': 'Marynowski', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asthma and Allergy, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Lodzkie, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Seweryn', 'firstname': 'Karbownik Michał', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Lodzkie, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Janusz', 'firstname': 'Szemraj', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Piotr', 'firstname': 'Kuna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asthma and Allergy, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Lodzkie, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Panek', 'firstname': 'Michał Gabriel', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asthma and Allergy, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Lodzkie, Poland.'}]"

Schizophyllum commune, a basidiomycete fungus, is one of the most common fungi that causes non-Aspergillus ABPM.
Herein, we attempted to clarify the clinical characteristics of ABPM caused by S. commune (ABPM-Sc) compared with those of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).
Patients with ABPM-Sc or ABPA were recruited from a nationwide survey in Japan, a multicenter cohort, and a fungal database at the Medical Mycology Research Center of Chiba University. The definition of culture-positive ABPM-Sc/ABPA is as follows: (1) fulfills five or more of the 10 diagnostic criteria for ABPM proposed by Asano et al., and (2) positive culture of S. commune/Aspergillus spp. in sputum, bronchial lavage fluid, or mucus plugs in the bronchi.
Thirty patients with ABPM-Sc and 46 with ABPA were recruited. Patients with ABPM-Sc exhibited less severe asthma and presented with better pulmonary function than those with ABPA (p = 0.008-0.03). Central bronchiectasis was more common in ABPM-Sc than that in ABPA, whereas peripheral lung lesions, including infiltrates/ground-glass opacities or fibrotic/cystic changes, were less frequent in ABPM-Sc. Aspergillus fumigatus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E was negative in 10 patients (34%) with ABPM-Sc, who demonstrated a lower prevalence of asthma and levels of total serum IgE than those with ABPM-Sc positive for A. fumigatus-specific IgE or ABPA.

31644151,LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury,2012,"Monoclonal antibodies are immunoglobulins that have a high degree of specificity (mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse dervied (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, bacterial diseases (such as anthrax) and viral infections (such as COVID-19). Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2022, more than 80 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved for use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis, herpes simplex, varicella zoster (shingles) and hepatitis B.",,[]
