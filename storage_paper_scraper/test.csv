They share similar etiology, pathogenesis, and pathological changes. Due to the anatomical continuity between the upper and lower respiratory tracts, allergic inflammation in the nasal cavity can readily propagate downwards, leading to bronchial inflammation and asthma. AR serves as a significant risk factor for AS by potentially inducing airway hyperresponsiveness in patients. Currently, there is a lack of reliable predictors for the progression from AR to AS.
In this exhaustive investigation, we reexamined peripheral blood single cell RNA sequencing datasets from patients with AS following AR and healthy individuals. In addition, we used the bulk RNA sequencing dataset as a validation lineup, which included AS, AR, and healthy controls. Using marker genes of related cell subtype, signatures predicting the progression of AR to AS were generated.
We identified a subtype of immune-activating effector T cells that can distinguish patients with AS after AR. By combining specific marker genes of effector T cell subtype, we established prediction models of 16 markers. The model holds great promise for assessing AS risk in individuals with AR, providing innovative avenues for clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.
Subcluster T effector cells may play a key role in post-AR AS. Notably, ACTR3 and HSPA8 genes were significantly upregulated in the blood of AS patients compared to healthy patients.","Subcluster T effector cells may play a key role in post-AR AS.

This study investigated the causal relationship between allergic diseases and dementia using univariate and multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR) methods.
We selected genome-wide association studies including 66,645 patients with allergic diseases and 12,281 patients with dementia, with statistical datasets derived from the FinnGen Consortium of European origin. After a rigorous screening process for single nucleotide polymorphisms to eliminate confounding effects, MR estimation was performed mainly using the inverse variance weighting method and the MR-Egger method. Sensitivity analyses were performed using Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO test, MR Pleiotropy residuals and leave-one-out analysis.
Univariate and multivariate MR together demonstrated a causal relationship between atopic dermatitis and reduced vascular dementia (VaD) risk (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99, p = 0.031; OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95, p = 0.003). MVMR confirmed asthma was associated with a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71-0.94, p = 0.005) and may be associated with a reduction in the risk of VaD (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.99, p = 0.042); allergic rhinitis may be causally associated with an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.00-1.35, p = 0.046) and VaD (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62, p = 0.027). In sensitivity analyses, these findings were reliable.
MR methods have only demonstrated that allergic rhinitis dementia is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. Previously observed associations between other allergic diseases and dementia may be influenced by comorbidities and confounding factors rather than causality.",,,"Univariate and multivariate MR together demonstrated a causal relationship between atopic dermatitis and reduced vascular dementia (VaD) risk (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99, p = 0.031; OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95, p = 0.003).

Benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-5α receptor expressed on eosinophils, may be an option for treating EGPA.
We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3, randomized, active-controlled noninferiority trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of benralizumab as compared with mepolizumab. Adults with relapsing or refractory EGPA who were receiving standard care were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive benralizumab (30 mg) or mepolizumab (300 mg) subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at weeks 36 and 48 (prespecified noninferiority margin, -25 percentage points). Secondary end points included the accrued duration of remission, time to first relapse, oral glucocorticoid use, eosinophil count, and safety.
A total of 140 patients underwent randomization (70 assigned to each group). The adjusted percentage of patients with remission at weeks 36 and 48 was 59% in the benralizumab group and 56% in the mepolizumab group (difference, 3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -13 to 18; P = 0.73 for superiority), showing noninferiority but not superiority of benralizumab to mepolizumab. The accrued duration of remission and the time to first relapse were similar in the two groups. Complete withdrawal of oral glucocorticoids during weeks 48 through 52 was achieved in 41% of the patients who received benralizumab and 26% of those who received mepolizumab. The mean (±SD) blood eosinophil count at baseline was 306.0±225.0 per microliter in the benralizumab group and 384.9±563.6 per microliter in the mepolizumab group, decreasing to 32.4±40.8 and 71.8±54.4 per microliter, respectively, at week 52.

Past research has revealed that, besides the effect on the ASM's force generation, rho-kinase (ROCK) also regulates actin filament formation and filament network architecture and integrity, thus affecting ASM's cytoskeletal stiffness. The present review is not a comprehensive examination of the roles played by ROCK in regulating ASM function but is specifically focused on passive tension, which is partially determined by the cytoskeletal stiffness of ASM. Understanding the molecular basis for maintaining active force and passive tension in ASM by ROCK will allow us to determine the suitability of ROCK inhibitors and its downstream enzymes as a class of drugs in treating airway hyperresponsiveness seen in asthma. Because clinical trials using ROCK inhibitors in the treatment of asthma have yet to be conducted, the present review focuses on the in vitro effects of ROCK inhibitors on ASM's mechanical properties which include active force generation, relaxation, and passive stiffness. The review provides justification for future clinical trials in the treatment of asthma using ROCK inhibitors alone and in combination with other pharmacological and mechanical interventions.",,,,38392332,10.3390/biology13020115

It was indicated that ORD mainly occur due to repeated and prolonged exposure to noxious agents in the workplace. We also extracted the prevalence of ORD in different regions of Iran from the retrieved reports. Based on our literature review, the prevalence of ORD among Iranian workers highlights the importance of regular assessment of the risk of exposure to noxious agents in the workplace to develop measures for preventing potential adverse effects.",,,,38390570,10.3389/fmed.2024.1310040

However, the risks of respiratory diseases following SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been comprehensively understood. This study aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 increases the long-term risk of respiratory illness in patients with COVID-19.
In this longitudinal, population-based cohort study, we built three distinct cohorts age 37-73 years using the UK Biobank database; a COVID-19 group diagnosed in medical records between January 30th, 2020 and October 30th, 2022, and two control groups, a contemporary control group and a historical control group, with cutoff dates of October 30th, 2022 and October 30th, 2019, respectively. The follow-up period of all three groups was 2.7 years (the median (IQR) follow-up time was 0.8 years). Respiratory outcomes diagnosed in medical records included common chronic pulmonary diseases (asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), and lung cancer. For the data analysis, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% CIs using Cox regression models, following the application of inverse probability weights (IPTW).
A total of 3 cohorts were included in this study; 112,311 individuals in the COVID-19 group with a mean age (±SDs) of 56.2 (8.1) years, 359,671 in the contemporary control group, and 370,979 in the historical control group. Compared with the contemporary control group, those infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited elevated risks for developing respiratory diseases. This includes asthma, with a HR of 1.49 and a 95% CI 1.28-1.74; bronchiectasis (1.30; 1.06-1.61); COPD (1.59; 1.41-1.81); ILD (1.81; 1.38-2.21); PVD (1.59; 1.39-1.82); and lung cancer (1.39; 1.13-1.71). With the severity of the acute phase of COVID-19, the risk of pre-described respiratory outcomes increases progressively. Besides, during the 24-months follow-up, we observed an increasing trend in the risks of asthma and bronchiectasis over time. Additionally, the HR of lung cancer for 0-6 month follow-up was 3.07 (CI 1.73-5.44), and the association of lung cancer with COVID-19 disease disappeared at 6-12 month follow-up (1.06; 0.43-2.64) and at 12-24 months (1.02; 0.45-2.34). Compared to those with one SARS-CoV-2 infection, reinfected patients were at a higher risk of asthma (3.0; 1.32-6.84), COPD (3.07; 1.42-6.65), ILD (3.61; 1.11-11.8), and lung cancer (3.20; 1.59-6.45). Similar findings were noted when comparing with a historical cohort serving as a control group, including asthma (1.31; 1.13-1.52); bronchiectasis (1.53; 1.23-1.89); COPD (1.41; 1.24-1.59); ILD (2.53; 2.05-3.13); PVD (2.30; 1.98-2.66); and lung cancer (2.23; 1.78-2.79).
Our research suggests that patients with COVID-19 may have an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases, and the risk increases with the severity of infection and reinfection. Even during the 24-month follow-up, the risk of asthma and bronchiectasis continued to increase. Hence, implementing appropriate follow-up strategies for these individuals is crucial to monitor and manage potential long-term respiratory health issues. Additionally, the increased risk in lung cancer in the COVID-19 individuals was probably due to the diagnostic tests conducted and incidental diagnoses.

We first conducted a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews to explore the objectives that children aged 8-17 years, their parents, and their physicians seek to achieve when taking/giving/prescribing a treatment for asthma. Following the grounded theory approach, each interview was independently coded by two researchers; reconciled codes were used to assess code frequency, categories were defined, and the main objectives identified. We then conducted a quantitative study based on questionnaires using these objectives to determine how children/parents/physicians ranked these objectives and whether their responses were aligned.
We interviewed 71 participants (31 children, 30 parents and 10 physicians) in the qualitative study and identified seven objectives associated with treatment uptake and five objectives associated with treatment modalities. We included 291 participants (137 children, 137 parents, and 17 physicians) in the quantitative study. We found little correlation between child, parent, and physician scores for each of the objectives. Each child's asthma history influenced the choice of scores assigned to each objective by the child, parents, and physician.
The identified objectives are quantifiable and relevant to the management of asthma in the short and long term. They can therefore be incorporated as parameters for future ADMS. Shared decision-making seems essential to achieve consensus among children, parents, and physicians when choosing the weight to assign to each of these objectives.","The identified objectives are quantifiable and relevant to the management of asthma in the short and long term.

In order to characterize patients with NCFB, as well as their etiologies, microbiological profiles, and outcomes, we therefore carried out this investigation.
This retrospective cohort study was carried out at the Jordan University Hospital (JUH), a tertiary facility located in Amman, Jordan. Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (NCFB) was defined as an HRCT scan typical for bronchiectasis along with a negative sweat chloride test to rule out cystic fibrosis. Patients' data were collected by the use of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) at our institution. Frequent exacerbation was defined as more than 2 exacerbations in 1 year of the onset of the diagnosis.
A total of 79 patients were included, and 54.4% of them were female. The mean and standard deviation of the patient's age was 48.61 ± 19.62. The etiologies of bronchiectasis were evident in 79.7% of the sample.

This evaluation assessed the effectiveness of this longitudinal quality improvement CHW intervention in reducing asthma morbidity and healthcare utilization. All patients aged 2-18 who met the high-risk clinical criteria in outpatient settings or those who visited the ED due to asthma were offered the program. A within-subject study design analyzed asthma morbidity and healthcare utilization at baseline and follow-up. Multivariable mixed-effects regression models, adjusted for baseline demographic and asthma characteristics, were used to assess changes over time. Among 123 patients, the average age was 8.8 (4.4) years, and 89.3% were non-Hispanic black. Significant reductions were observed in the average daytime symptoms days (baseline 4.1 days and follow-up 1.6 days), night-time symptoms days (3.0 days and 1.2 days), and days requiring rescue medication (4.1 days and 1.6 days) in the past two weeks (all p < 0.001). The average number of emergency department visits decreased from 0.92 one year before to 0.44 one year after program participation, a 52% reduction (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found in hospital admissions. These results support the use of a collaborative approach to implement the CHW home visiting program as part of standard care for pediatric asthma patients in urban settings. This approach has the potential to reduce asthma disparities and underscores the valuable role of CHWs within the clinical care team.",,,,38388809,"10.1007/s10900-024-01331-y

This study examined the relationship between the IL-6 (- 174G/C) gene polymorphism and mild and severe asthma, focusing on its influence on type 2 inflammation.
Our study comprised 98 patients with mild asthma and 116 with severe asthma. Additionally, we recruited 121 healthy participants to serve as controls for comparative analyses. The IL-6 gene (- 174G/C) polymorphism was assessed utilizing the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
In our study, the risk of mild asthma exhibited a significant fourfold increase in individuals with the GG genotype pattern compared to healthy controls, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 4.4 (p < 0.001). Conversely, we found no significant correlation between the IL-6 - 174G/C gene polymorphism and severe asthma when compared to the healthy control group. However, a noteworthy pattern emerged when we compared subgroups of mild and severe asthma. The risk of severe asthma increased fivefold in individuals with the GC polymorphism pattern, with an OR of 4.99 (p < 0.001), while the likelihood of mild asthma showed a similar fourfold increase with the GG polymorphism pattern, OR = 4.4 (p < 0.001). Consequently, we observed a significantly higher frequency of the C allele in patients with severe asthma, whereas the G allele was more prevalent in individuals with mild asthma (p = 0.05). Additionally, the correlation between markers of type 2 inflammation and the dominant model of the IL-6 gene -174G/C polymorphism (CC + CG vs GG) revealed a significant increase in total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), Blood Eosinophil Counts (BEC), and Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) levels in asthmatic patients with the CC + CG gene pattern compared to those with GG, with p-values of 0.04, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively. Furthermore, after adjusting for other risk factors, the likelihood of developing severe asthma increased from fourfold to eightfold, with an OR of 8.12 (p = 0.01) with (CC + CG) gene pattern. Other predictors for severe asthma included older age and childhood-onset disease (OR = 1.13 and 19.19, p < 0.001). Allergic rhinitis (AR) and nasal polyps (NP) also demonstrated a substantial association with an increased risk of severe asthma, with odds ratios of 5 and 32.29 (p = 0.01 and < 0.001), respectively. Additionally, elevated Body Mass Index (BMI), BEC, and FeNO were linked to severe asthma, with ORs of 1.11, 1.00, and 1.04, respectively (p = 0.04, 0.05, and 0.001).
This study illuminated the intricate relationship between the IL-6 gene polymorphism, type 2 inflammation markers, and diverse risk factors in shaping asthma severity. As a significant association between the GG polymorphism of the IL-6 gene (- 174G/C) and mild asthma was found, while possessing at least one C allele, whether in a homozygous (CC) or heterozygous (CG) combination, independently predicts the likelihood of severe asthma.","This study illuminated the intricate relationship between the IL-6 gene polymorphism, type 2 inflammation markers, and diverse risk factors in shaping asthma severity.

The Mitigating the Health Effects of Desert Dust Storms Using Exposure-Reduction Approaches randomised controlled trial assessed the impact of exposure reduction recommendations, including indoor air filtration, on childhood asthma control during high desert dust storms (DDS) season in Cyprus and Greece.
Primary school children with asthma were randomised into three parallel groups: (a) no intervention (controls); (b) outdoor intervention (early alerts notifications, recommendations to stay indoors and limit outdoor physical activity during DDS) and (c) combined intervention (same as (b) combined with indoor air purification with high efficiency particulate air filters in children's homes and school classrooms. Asthma symptom control was assessed using the childhood Asthma Control Test (c-ACT), spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC)) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO).
In total, 182 children with asthma (age; mean=9.5, SD=1.63) were evaluated during 2019 and 2021. After three follow-up months, the combined intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in c-ACT in comparison to controls (β=2.63, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.54, p=0.007), which was more profound among atopic children (β=3.56, 95% CI 0.04 to 7.07, p=0.047).

However, standard meta-analysis tools are not well suited to synthesising heterogeneous multimorbidity data.
We developed a statistical model to synthesise data on associations between diseases and nationally representative prevalence estimates and applied the model to South Africa. Published and unpublished data were reviewed, and meta-regression analysis was conducted to assess pairwise associations between 10 conditions: arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, diabetes, HIV, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), stroke and tuberculosis. The national prevalence of each condition in individuals aged 15 and older was then independently estimated, and these estimates were integrated with the ORs from the meta-regressions in a statistical model, to estimate the national prevalence of each condition combination.
The strongest disease associations in South Africa are between COPD and asthma (OR 14.6, 95% CI 10.3 to 19.9), COPD and IHD (OR 9.2, 95% CI 8.3 to 10.2) and IHD and stroke (OR 7.2, 95% CI 5.9 to 8.4). The most prevalent condition combinations in individuals aged 15+ are hypertension and arthritis (7.6%, 95% CI 5.8% to 9.5%), hypertension and diabetes (7.5%, 95% CI 6.4% to 8.6%) and hypertension and HIV (4.8%, 95% CI 3.3% to 6.6%). The average numbers of comorbidities are greatest in the case of COPD (2.3, 95% CI 2.1 to 2.6), stroke (2.1, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.4) and IHD (1.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2).
South Africa has high levels of HIV, hypertension, diabetes and arthritis, by international standards, and these are reflected in the most prevalent condition combinations. However, less prevalent conditions such as COPD, stroke and IHD contribute disproportionately to the multimorbidity burden, with high rates of comorbidity. This modelling approach can be used in other settings to characterise the most important disease combinations and levels of comorbidity.","South Africa has high levels of HIV, hypertension, diabetes and arthritis, by international standards, and these are reflected in the most prevalent condition combinations.

What are the most relevant changes in computed tomography (CT-scan) parameters over time for assessing response to treatment?
In this ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial (NEBULAMB), asthmatic patients with available CT-scan and without exacerbation during a 4-month ABPA exacerbation treatment period (corticosteroids and itraconazole) were included. Changed CT-scan parameters were assessed by systematic analyses of CT-scan findings at initiation (M0) and end of treatment (M4). CT-scans were assessed by two radiologists blinded to the clinical data. Radiological parameters were determined by selecting those showing significant changes over time. Improvement of at least one, without worsening of the others, defined the radiological response. Agreement between radiological changes, clinical and immunologic responses was likewise investigated.
Among the 139 originally randomized patients, 132 were included. We identified 5 CT-scan parameters showing significant changes at M4: mucoid impaction extent, mucoid impaction density, centrilobular micronodules, consolidation/ground-glass opacities and bronchial wall thickening (P<0.05). These changes were only weakly associated with one another, except for mucoid impaction extent and density. No agreement was observed between clinical or immunologic and radiological responses, assessed as an overall response, or considering each of the parameters (Cohen's κ, -0.01 to 0.24).
Changes in extent and density of mucoid impactions, centrilobular micronodules, consolidation/ground-glass opacities and thickening of the bronchial walls were found to be the most relevant CT-scan parameters to assess radiological response to treatment.

Although methodological constraints have limited the number of air toxics assessed for associations with health and disease, advances in machine learning (ML) enable the assessment of a much larger set of environmental exposures. We used ML methods to conduct a retrospective study to identify combinations of 109 air toxics associated with asthma symptoms among 269 elementary school students in Spokane, Washington. Data on the frequency of asthma symptoms for these children were obtained from Spokane Public Schools. Their exposure to air toxics was estimated by using the Environmental Protection Agency's Air Toxics Screening Assessment and National Air Toxics Assessment. We defined three exposure periods: the most recent year (2019), the last three years (2017-2019), and the last five years (2014-2019). We analyzed the data using the ML-based Data-driven ExposurE Profile (DEEP) extraction method. DEEP identified 25 air toxic combinations associated with asthma symptoms in at least one exposure period. Three combinations (1,1,1-trichloroethane, 2-nitropropane, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) were significantly associated with asthma symptoms in all three exposure periods. Four air toxics (1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, BIS (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and 2,4-dinitrophenol) were associated only in combination with other toxics, and would not have been identified by traditional statistical methods. The application of DEEP also identified a vulnerable subpopulation of children who were exposed to 13 of the 25 significant combinations in at least one exposure period. On average, these children experienced the largest number of asthma symptoms in our sample. By providing evidence on air toxic combinations associated with childhood asthma, our findings may contribute to the regulation of these toxics to improve children's respiratory health.",,,,38387571,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171102

We conducted a comprehensive comparison of these proposed systems, assessing their classification performance through metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy. The main approach to developing a machine learning-based system for classifying respiratory sounds involved the combination of a technique for extracting features from an unknown input sound with a classification method to determine its belonging class. The characterization techniques used in this study are based on the cepstral analysis, which was extensively employed in the automatic speech recognition field. While MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) feature extraction methods are commonly used in respiratory sounds classification, our study introduces a novelty by employing GFCC (Gammatone-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and BFCC (Bark-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for this purpose. For the classification task, we employed two types of neural networks: the MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), a feedforward neural network, and a variant of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) recurrent neural network called BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM). The proposed classification systems are evaluated using a database consisting of 497 wheezing segments and 915 normal respiratory segments, which are recorded from individuals diagnosticated with asthma and individuals without any respiratory issues, respectively. The highest classification performance was achieved by the BFCC-BiLSTM model, which demonstrated an exceptional accuracy rate of 99.8%.",,,,38387384,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108190

This study aims to investigate changes in the homing of BMSCs in bronchial asthma, focusing on the Notch homolog (Notch)1/Jagged1 signaling pathway's role in regulating T helper 1(Th1)/T helper 2(Th2) drift. Additionally, we further explore the effects and mechanisms of homologous BMSCs implantation in asthma-related immune inflammation. Following intervention with BMSCs, a significant improvement in the pathology of rats with asthma was observed. Simultaneously, a reduction in the expression of inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin(IL)-4, and IL-13 was observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Furthermore, there was an increase in the expression of Th1 cytokine Interferon-γ（IFN-γ）and the transcription factor T-box expressed in T cell (T-bet), while the expression of Th2 cytokine IL-13 and transcription factor GATA binding protein (GATA)-3 decreased in lung tissue. This indicates that the Th1/Th2 drift leans towards Th1, which a crucial in ameliorating asthma inflammation. Importantly, inhibition of the Notch1 signaling pathway led to an increased expression of the Stromal cell-derived factor-1(SDF-1)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor (CXCR)4 chemokine axis. Consequently, the homing ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to asthma-affected lung tissue was significantly enhanced. BMSCs demonstrated heightened efficacy in regulating the cytokine/chemokine network and Th1/Th2 balance, thereby restoring a stable state during the immune response process in asthma. In conclusion, inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway enhances the expression of the SDF-1 and CXCR4 chemokine axis, facilitating the migration of allogeneic BMSCs to injured lung tissues. This, in turn, promotes immune regulation and improves the Th1/Th2 imbalance, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect on asthmatic airway inflammation.",,,,38387192,10.1016/j.intimp.2024.111713

We used data from the Norwegian Cohort of Patients in OMT and Other Drug Treatment (NorComt) study. Of 283 patients who entered OMT, 176 were included for analysis at a 1-year follow-up. Participants provided self-reported data during structured interviews on somatic conditions, somatic symptoms, substance use severity measures, and mental distress. A multivariable linear regression analysis identified factors associated with changes in the burden of somatic symptoms.
Patients entering OMT reported a high prevalence of somatic conditions at the beginning of treatment, with 3 of 5 patients reporting at least one. The most prevalent condition was hepatitis C, followed by asthma and high blood pressure. Patients reported experiencing a high number of somatic symptoms. The intensity of these symptoms varied across a wide spectrum, with oral health complaints and reduced memory perceived as the most problematic. Overall, for the entire sample, there was no significant change in somatic symptoms from baseline to 1 year. Further analysis indicated that those who reported a higher burden of somatic symptoms at baseline had the greatest improvement at the 1-year follow-up. A higher number of somatic conditions and higher mental distress at baseline was associated with improvements in somatic symptoms burden at follow-up.

However, in real-world clinical practice, we sometimes encounter patients with pollen allergy suffering from severe extrarespiratory symptoms including skin, gastrointestinal, or flu-like symptoms in relation to exposure to sensitized pollen.
The aim of this study was to elucidate the extrarespiratory symptoms in patients with pollen allergy METHODS: We performed a non-drug-focused, prospective study of patients with pollen allergy (n=384). During the 1-year observational period, they were asked to complete a weekly e-diary consisting of visual analogue scale (VAS) scores to assess all symptoms experienced in various organs over the past week. An association between seasonal pollen levels and seasonal increase in VAS scores was evaluated using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures. A k-means cluster analysis was performed to identify a group of patients experiencing stronger extrarespiratory symptoms.
In patients sensitized to grass or birch pollen, higher seasonal levels of these pollen grains were associated with higher VAS scores for headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin symptoms, and fatigue. A cluster analysis identified a group of severe pollen-allergic patients with higher extrarespiratory symptoms (n=42). This group was characterized by a higher frequency of comorbid food allergy/atopic dermatitis, higher rate of IgE-sensitization to pollens, and higher impaired activity and work productivity.
This 1-year survey identified a small but non-negligible group of patients with pollen-related extrarespiratory symptoms.

In order to assess upper and lower airway unity and identify a possible common pathogenesis in CRSwNP with asthma.
This study analyzed the expression of proteins and metabolites in nasal lavage fluid cells (NLFCs) and induced sputum cells (ISCs). Differentially expressed proteins and their function-related metabolites in the upper and lower airways of CRSwNP patients with or without asthma were identified, relevant signaling pathways were analyzed, and key pathway-related proteins were identified. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was used to verify these target proteins.
Protein or metabolite expression between NLFCs and ISCs was highly correlated and conservative based on expression profiles and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Seventeen differentially co-expressed proteins and their function-related 13 metabolites were identified in the NLFCs and ISCs of CRSwNP, while 11 proteins and 11 metabolites were identified in CRSwNP with asthma. An asthma pathway was involved in the co-pathogenesis of upper and lower airways in whether CRSwNP or CRSwNP with asthma. The asthma pathway-related proteins proteoglycan 2 (PRG2) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), as the core of the protein-metabolism interaction networks between the upper and lower airways, were both highly co-expressed in NLFCs and ISCs in patients with either CRSwNP or CRSwNP with asthma by PRM validation.

MUC5AC mucin levels were significantly elevated in the e-cigarette exposure, OVA sensitization, and e-cigarette-exposed OVA sensitization groups, whereas MUC5B mucin levels were significantly elevated in the OVA sensitization and e-cigarette-exposed OVA sensitization groups.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that BCD significantly disrupted vagal innervation in the lung.
A total of 15 patients with severe asthma were enrolled in this prospective, single-center pilot study. Patients underwent bifurcated BCD treatment at a 30-day interval after baseline assessment. Follow-up through 12 months included assessment of adverse events, technical feasibility, and changes in pulmonary function; asthma control questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7); and asthma control test (ACT).
BCD was performed on all 15 severe asthma patients, with technical feasibility of 96.7%.

Data on fungal disease were obtained from different search engines: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scielo and Lilacs. For population and at risk diseases, we used statistics from worldometer, UNAIDS, and WHO. Incidence, prevalence, and absolute numbers were calculated based on the population at risk. Panamanian population in 2022 was 4,429,739. We estimated that 85,530 (1.93 %) people suffer from fungal diseases. The most frequent fungal infection was recurrent Candida vaginitis (3320/100,000). There are 31,000 HIV-infected people in Panama and based on the number of cases not receiving anti-retroviral therapy (14,570), and previous reports of prevalence of opportunistic infections, we estimated annual incidences of 4.0/100,000 for cryptococcal meningitis, 29.6/100,000 for oral candidiasis, 23.2/100,000 for esophageal candidiasis, 29.3/100,000 for Pneumocystis pneumonia, 15.1/100,000, and for histoplasmosis.

In response to viral infection, the host will induce acute tissue inflammation pulled by granulocytes. Upon hyperactivation, neutrophil granulocytes may cause undue tissue damage through proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. Here, we assess the potential of protease inhibitors (PI) derived from potatoes in inhibiting viral infection and reducing tissue damage. The original full spectrum of potato PI was developed into five fractions by means of chromatography and hydrolysis. Individual fractions showed varying inhibitory efficacy towards a panel of proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, ACE2, elastase, and cathepsins B and L. The fractions did not interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro. Importantly, two of the fractions fully inhibited elastin-degrading activity of complete primary human neutrophil degranulate. These data warrant further development of potato PI fractions for biomedical purposes, including tissue damage crucial to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. KEY MESSAGES: Protease inhibitor fractions from potato differentially inhibit a series of human proteases involved in viral replication and in tissue damage by overshoot inflammation. Protease inhibition of cell surface receptors such as ACE2 does not prevent virus infection of Vero cells in vitro. Protease inhibitors derived from potato can fully inhibit elastin-degrading primary human neutrophil proteases. Protease inhibitor fractions can be produced at high scale (hundreds of thousands of kilograms, i.e., tons) allowing economically feasible application in lower and higher income countries.",,,,38381158,"10.1007/s00109-024-02423-x

IL-33 is increased in asthmatics, and its blockade suppresses asthma-like inflammation in mouse models. Homeostatic control of IL-33 signaling is poorly understood. Because the IL-33 receptor, ST2, acts via cascades used by the TLR family, similar feedback mechanisms may exist. MicroRNA (miR)-146a is induced by LPS-mediated TLR4 signaling and serves as a feedback inhibitor. Therefore, we explored whether miR-146a has a role in IL-33 signaling. IL-33 induced cellular and exosomal miR-146a expression in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). BMMCs transfected with a miR-146a antagonist or derived from miR-146a knockout mice showed enhanced cytokine expression in response to IL-33, suggesting that miR-146a is a negative regulator of IL-33-ST2 signaling. In vivo, miR-146a expression in plasma exosomes was elevated after i.p. injection of IL-33 in wild-type but not mast cell-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice. Finally, KitW-sh/W-sh mice acutely reconstituted with miR-146a knockout BMMCs prior to IL-33 challenge had elevated plasma IL-6 levels compared with littermates receiving wild-type BMMCs.

Lately, much attention has been given to the time frame the interaction occurs since the host response (immune or biological) to environmental triggers, differs at different developmental ages.

It is widely reported in treating inflammatory diseases such as eczema, dermatitis, arthritis, allergic asthma and colitis. Although several studies claim that its volatile oil and organic reagent extracts have certain anti-inflammatory effects, the water-soluble fractions and molecular mechanisms have not been studied.
To evaluate the therapeutic effect of A. argyi water extract (AAWE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses and to identify the most effective water-soluble subfractions. Moreover, the relevant pharmacological and molecular mechanisms by which the active subfraction mitigates inflammation were further investigated.
Firstly, RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS were treated with AAWE (50, 100, and 200 μg/mL) or the water-soluble subfractions separated by D101 macroporous resin (AAWE1-AAWE4, 100 μg/mL), and NO production and mRNA levels of inflammatory genes were evaluated to determine the most effective water-soluble subfractions. Secondly, the chemical components of the active subfraction (AAWE4) were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Thirdly, transcriptome and network pharmacology analysis, RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays were conducted to explore the underlying anti-inflammatory mechanism and active compounds of AAWE4. Subsequently, the binding ability of the potential active components in AAWE4 to the core targets was further determined by molecular docking. Eventually, the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of AAWE4 (1.17, 2.34 and 4.68 g/kg, administered per day for 7 d) was evaluated in mice with LPS-induced systemic inflammation.
In this study, AAWE showed excellent anti-inflammatory effects, and its water-soluble subfraction AAWE4 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on NO concentration and inflammatory gene mRNA expression after LPS stimulation, indicating that it was the most effective subfraction. Thereafter, four main compounds in AAWE4 were confirmed or tentatively identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS, including three flavonoid glycosides and one phenolic acid. Furthermore, the transcriptome and network pharmacology analysis showed that AAWE4 inhibited inflammation via multiple pathways and multiple targets. Based on the RT-qPCR and Western blotting results, AAWE4 downregulated not only the p38, PI3K, CCL5, MMP9, AP-1, and BCL3 mRNA expression levels activated by LPS but also their upstream and downstream protein expression levels and protein phosphorylation (p-AKT/AKT, p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, p-JNK/JNK). Moreover, four identified compounds (isochlorogenic acid A, vicenin-2, schaftoside and isoschaftoside) could significantly inhibit NO content and the overexpression of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and COX-2 mRNA induced by LPS, and the molecular docking confirmed the high binding activity of four active compounds with selected core targets (p38, AKT1, MMP9, and CCL5). In addition, the mRNA expression and immunohistochemical analysis showed that AAWE44 could inhibit lung inflammation via multiple pathways and multiple targets in vivo.
The findings of this study suggest that the water-soluble subfraction AAWE4 from A. argyi ameliorated the inflammation caused by LPS through multiple pathways and multiple targets in vitro and in vivo, providing scientific support for the medicinal use of A. argyi. Importantly, it shows that the A. argyi subfraction AAWE4 can be developed as an anti-inflammatory drug.",,,"In this study, AAWE showed excellent anti-inflammatory effects, and its water-soluble subfraction AAWE4 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on NO concentration and inflammatory gene mRNA expression after LPS stimulation, indicating that it was the most effective subfraction.

Based on the RT-qPCR and Western blotting results, AAWE4 downregulated not only the p38, PI3K, CCL5, MMP9, AP-1, and BCL3 mRNA expression levels activated by LPS but also their upstream and downstream protein expression levels and protein phosphorylation (p-AKT/AKT, p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, p-JNK/JNK). Moreover, four identified compounds (isochlorogenic acid A, vicenin-2, schaftoside and isoschaftoside) could significantly inhibit NO content and the overexpression of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and COX-2 mRNA induced by LPS, and the molecular docking confirmed the high binding activity of four active compounds with selected core targets (p38, AKT1, MMP9, and CCL5). In addition, the mRNA expression and immunohistochemical analysis showed that AAWE44 could inhibit lung inflammation via multiple pathways and multiple targets in vivo.",38380576,10.1016/j.jep.2023.117364

Children who have recurrent wheezing experience disease-related morbidity, including increased emergency visits and hospitalizations. Early-life lower respiratory tract viral infections are linked to recurrent wheezing and eventual asthma onset. Identifying high-risk children is crucial, with the frequency and severity of wheezing episodes being good predictors of long-term outcomes. Aim To identify predictors of severe exacerbations in children with recurrent wheezing. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 168 pediatric patients with recurrent wheezing followed up at our outpatient clinic. The outcome of interest was the occurrence of a severe exacerbation, defined as any exacerbation requiring hospitalization and the need for supplemental oxygenation or ventilatory support. Results The median age of the first wheezing exacerbation was five months, with a predominance of the male gender. Approximately two-thirds of the patients had a family history of atopy. Comorbid allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis were present in 15.4% and 16.7% of patients, respectively. Twenty percent of patients had a severe wheezing exacerbation as the first form of presentation, and 30% presented at least one severe exacerbation from the first presentation to the last follow-up. Patients with severe exacerbations were younger at the first episode (median age 4 months, IQR 2-7, versus 7 months, IQR 4-12, p=0.027) and more frequently had a family history of atopy (71.7% versus 55.6%, p=0.050). In this cohort, patients who initially presented with a severe episode are at increased risk of incident severe exacerbations during follow-up, HR 2.24 (95%CI 1.01-4.95). Conclusions We know that the severity of exacerbations in children with recurrent wheezing correlates with the long-term outcomes of the disease. Therefore, preventing severe exacerbations can positively impact the prognosis of these patients. In this analysis, we found independent predictors of severe exacerbations to be the first clinical episode before the age of three months and a family history of atopy. We also found that patients whose initial presentation was severe have a higher risk of new severe exacerbations. Therefore, these subgroups of patients should be closely monitored by pediatricians.",,,,38380209,10.7759/cureus.52667

CRS is a heterogeneous disease requiring multiple biomarkers to explain its pathogenesis. This study aimed to develop potential biomarkers for predicting CRS in adult asthmatic patients in a real-world clinical setting.
This study enrolled 108 adult asthmatic patients who had maintained anti-asthmatic medications, including medium-to-high doses of inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β2-agonists, and compared clinical characteristics between patients with CRS (CRS group) and those without CRS (non-CRS group). CRS was diagnosed based on the results of paranasal sinus X-ray and/or osteomeatal-unit CT as well as clinical symptoms. Type-2 parameters, including blood eosinophil count, serum levels of periostin/dipeptidyl peptidase 10 (DPP10) and clinical parameters, such as FEV1% and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), were analyzed. All biomarkers were evaluated by logistic regression and classification/regression tree (CRT) analyses.

The aetiological diagnosis of allergy using molecular components of allergens allows a more precise definition of the patient's IgE repertoire. Precision medicine is a structural model aimed at personalising healthcare and places the patient at the centre of the specialist's decision-making process. To this end, an accurate characterisation of the external exposome at a molecular level and their putative role as clinically relevant allergens is essential to elucidate the phenotypic diversity of atopic disease, with a view to personalising diagnosis and therapy. It has been proposed a decision algorithm, the Top-Down approach, where the clinical history is set first and is followed by the use of skin tests or specific IgE techniques, which facilitates the clinicians to make decisions. The therapeutic intervention driven by the standard diagnostic approach, but supported by these innovative tools, can lead to a better phenotyping of highly complex patients, and a more appropriate prescription of AIT. To this end, the allergen extracts used for diagnosis require to be of proven quality and contain the most relevant allergens.

This study employs a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and meta-analysis to identify metabolite targets potentially associated with allergic diseases.
A two-sample MR analysis was conducted to explore potential causal relationships between circulating and urinary metabolites and allergic diseases. Exposures were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 486 circulating metabolites and a GWAS of 55 targeted urinary metabolites. Outcome data for allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma, were obtained from the FinnGen biobank in Europe (cohort 1) and the Biobank Japan in Asia (cohort 2). MR results from both cohorts were combined using a meta-analysis.
MR analysis identified 50 circulating metabolites and 6 urinary metabolites in cohort 1 and 54 circulating metabolites and 2 urinary metabolites in cohort 2 as potentially causally related to allergic diseases.

In a Danish cohort consisting of all children aged 2-17 years redeeming inhaled corticosteroids in 2015, parental SEP impact on asthma outcomes was investigated. Workforce attachment, income, education, and metropolitan residence were chosen as covariates in logistic regression. Outcomes were uncontrolled (excessive use of short-acting beta2-agonists), exacerbating (oral corticosteroid use or hospitalization), and severe asthma (according to GINA 2020).
The cohort comprised 29,851 children (median age 8.0, 59% boys). 16% had uncontrolled asthma, 8% had ≥1 exacerbation. Lower income and metropolitan residence correlated with higher odds of poor control, exacerbations, and severe asthma. Lower education correlated with worse asthma outcomes. Education and income were protective factors in primary care, but not in specialist care. Metropolitan residence was the sole factor linked to specialist care referral for severe asthma.

We hypothesized that children from census tracts with high environmental injustice determined by the EJI would have a greater burden of asthma exacerbations, poorer asthma control, and poorer lung function over 12 months.
Children 6-18 years with asthma (N=575) from metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, completed a baseline research visit. Participant addresses were geocoded to obtain the EJI Social-Environmental ranking for each participant's census tract, which was divided into tertiles. Medical records were reviewed for 12 months for asthma exacerbations. A subset of participants completed a second research visit involving spirometry and questionnaires.
Census tracts with the greatest environmental injustice had more racial/ethnic minorities, lower socioeconomic status, more hazardous exposures (particularly to airborne pollutants), and greater proximity to railroads and heavily trafficked roadways. Children with asthma residing in high injustice census tracts had a longer duration of asthma, greater historical asthma-related healthcare utilization, poorer asthma symptom control and quality of life, and more impaired lung function. By 12 months, children from high injustice census tracts also had more asthma exacerbations with a shorter time to exacerbation and persistently more symptoms, poorer asthma control, and reduced lung function.

From the databases of 4 centers, a total of 756 lung function tests (194 healthy subjects, 175 with asthma, 71 with ACO, 78 with COPD and 238 with CF) were collected, and gradients among combinations of target parameters from spirometry (forced expiratory volume one second: FEV1; FEV1/forced vital capacity: FEV1/FVC; forced expiratory flow between 25-75% FVC: FEF25-75), and plethysmography (effective, resistive airway resistance: sReff; aerodynamic work of breathing at rest: sWOB), separately for in- and expiration (sReffIN, sReffEX, sWOBin, sWOBex) as well as static lung volumes (total lung capacity: TLC; functional residual capacity: FRCpleth; residual volume: RV), the control of breathing (mouth occlusion pressure: P0.1; mean inspiratory flow: VT/TI; the inspiratory to total time ratio: TI/Ttot) and the inspiratory impedance (Zinpleth = P0.1/VT/TI) were explored. Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were applied to identify discriminant functions and classification rules using recursive partitioning decision trees. LDA showed a high classification accuracy (sensitivity and specificity > 90%) for healthy subjects, COPD and CF. The accuracy dropped for asthma (~70%) and even more for ACO (~60%). The decision tree revealed that P0.1, sRtot, and VT/TI differentiate most between healthy and asthma (68.9%), COPD (82.1%), and CF (60.6%). Moreover, using sWOBex and Zinpleth ACO can be discriminated from asthma and COPD (60%). Thus, the functional complexity of obstructive lung diseases can be understood, if specific spirometric and plethysmographic parameters are used. Moreover, the newly described parameters of airway dynamics and the central control of breathing including Zinpleth may well serve as promising functional marker in the field of precision medicine.",,,,38377145,"10.1371/journal.pone.0292270

Worldwide prevalence of allergic diseases has grown to an estimated 262 million for asthma, 400 million for allergic rhinitis (or hay fever), 171 million with atopic dermatitis (or eczema), and over 200 million for food allergy. In Africa, considerable variability exists in the data surrounding prevalence at the continent-wide, regional, and study site levels. Furthermore, research conducted in many rural areas and underdeveloped countries in Africa remains limited, and presently, little has been done to characterize and map the extremely heterogeneous body of literature which confounds research efforts. This scoping review will seek to identify studies examining the prevalence, management strategies, outcomes, and associated risk factors for allergy related diseases in Africa. The Joanna Briggs Institute's scoping review methods will be followed, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) was used for writing the protocol. Four databases (Embase, Global Health, PubMed, African Journals Online) will be searched for literature published from 2003 to 2023 in any language. Title and abstract screening and full-text screening will be completed by two independent reviewers using Covidence; conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Data will be extracted using Covidence by two reviewers independently. To report the results, we will follow the PRISMA-ScR checklist and report descriptive statistics and a narrative summary.",,,,38377144,"10.1371/journal.pone.0297949

Long-read sequencing and hybrid assembly approaches that combine long- and short-read technologies are now being widely implemented in bacterial genomics and metagenomics. However, the use of long-read sequencing to investigate viral communities is still in its infancy. While Nanopore and PacBio technologies have been applied to viral metagenomics, it is not known to what extent different technologies will impact the reconstruction of the viral community. Thus, we constructed a mock bacteriophage community of previously sequenced phage genomes and sequenced them using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing technologies and tested a number of different assembly approaches. When using a single sequencing technology, Illumina assemblies were the best at recovering phage genomes. Nanopore- and PacBio-only assemblies performed poorly in comparison to Illumina in both genome recovery and error rates, which both varied with the assembler used. The best Nanopore assembly had errors that manifested as SNPs and INDELs at frequencies 41 and 157 % higher than found in Illumina only assemblies, respectively. While the best PacBio assemblies had SNPs at frequencies 12 and 78 % higher than found in Illumina-only assemblies, respectively. Despite high-read coverage, long-read-only assemblies recovered a maximum of one complete genome from any assembly, unless reads were down-sampled prior to assembly. Overall the best approach was assembly by a combination of Illumina and Nanopore reads, which reduced error rates to levels comparable with short-read-only assemblies. When using a single technology, Illumina only was the best approach. The differences in genome recovery and error rates between technology and assembler had downstream impacts on gene prediction, viral prediction, and subsequent estimates of diversity within a sample. These findings will provide a starting point for others in the choice of reads and assembly algorithms for the analysis of viromes.",,,,38376377,10.1099/mgen.0.001198

Residential activities, such as intensive asthma camps at alpine altitude climate (AAC), can help reduce bronchial inflammation in patients who fail to achieve optimal control of the disease. Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be obtained using electronic devices such as e-Noses. We aimed to identify alterations in urinary e-Nose sensors among children with asthma participating in an intensive camp at AAC and to investigate associations between urinary e-Nose analysis and airway inflammation.
We analyzed data collected in children with asthma recruited between July and September 2020. All children were born and resided at altitudes below 600 m asl. Urinary VOCs (measured using the Cyranose 320® VOC analyzer), Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) and spirometry were evaluated upon children's arrival at the Istituto Pio XII, Misurina (BL), Italy, at 1756 m asl (T0), and after 7 (T1) and 15 days (T2) of stay.
Twenty-two patients (68.2% males; median age: 14.5 years) were enrolled. From T0 to T1 and T2, the negative trend for FeNO was significant (p < .001). Significant associations were observed between e-Nose sensors S7 (p = .002), S12 (p = .013), S16 (p = .027), S17 (p = .017), S22 (p = .029), S29 (p = .021), S31 (p = .009) and ΔFeNO at T0-T1.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of patients with CRD, carers and interested citizens regarding the relevance and need for a PPI network and suggestions for its implementation.
A qualitative study based on focus groups was conducted. Recruitment occurred through invitations on social media platforms and to patients who have participated in previous asthma studies of the team. Three focus groups were conducted, via video conference, using a semi-structured guide. Thematic analysis was performed by two independent researchers and discussed with the extended team.
Fifteen patients with CRD, one carer and one interested citizen (13 females, median 36 (range: 18-72) years) participated. All participants acknowledged the importance of implementing a collaborative network and demonstrated interest in being integrated. Participants acknowledged the importance of their involvement in several phases of the research cycle. The main aim identified for this network was to facilitate communication between patients and researchers. Participants regarded the integration of patients, carers, researchers and healthcare professionals from different scientific areas as relevant. The use of digital platforms to attract members and support the work, together with group dynamics and regular meetings, were some of the most relevant practical considerations for implementing the network. The identified facilitators for their engagement were sharing experiences, researchers' and healthcare professionals' support and feedback and schedule flexibility. The identified barriers included the amount of time dedicated, low health/digital literacy and the potential detachment of nondiagnosed patients or those with low symptom impact in daily life.
Patients, carers and citizens acknowledged the relevance of implementing a collaborative network and demonstrated interest in active participation in every stage of the health research cycle. A deeper knowledge of the barriers and facilitators identified in this study could support implementing these initiatives in Portugal.
This study was designed by a research team that included one patient with asthma and one carer. They were specifically involved in building the study protocol and the interview guide. They also gave feedback regarding the electronic consent form and the short sociodemographic questionnaire created, namely by removing noncontributing words or phrases and rewording expressions. The lay summary was written by another patient with asthma. All participants of this study were invited to implement and integrate the ConectAR network-a collaborative network of research in respiratory health.
In Portugal, chronic respiratory patients do not have an active role as 'coinvestigators'. This study aimed to acknowledge if patients and citizens considered a patient and public involvement network useful, whose main purpose would be to facilitate communication between patients and researchers. A study based on online group interviews was carried out with patients with chronic respiratory diseases and interested citizens, both recruited on social media platforms. Participants considered that bringing together patients, carers, researchers and healthcare professionals is valuable because sharing different experiences and perspectives may help patients to improve their daily lives and increase research quality. In conclusion, patients agree that implementing a collaborative network with researchers and healthcare professionals and participating in the health research cycle is quite preponderant. Acknowledging what can help and deter this network may be beneficial to implementing this type of initiative in Portugal.","Patients, carers and citizens acknowledged the relevance of implementing a collaborative network and demonstrated interest in active participation in every stage of the health research cycle.

Skin tape-strips were obtained and analyzed with RNA-Seq from children with moderate allergic asthma (MAA) (n = 11, mean age 7.00; SD = 1.67), severe allergic asthma (SAA) (n = 9, mean age 9.11; SD = 2.37), and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 12, mean age 7.36; SD = 2.03). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by fold change ≥2 with a false discovery rate <0.05. Transcriptomic biomarkers were analyzed for their accuracy in distinguishing asthma from HCs, their relationships with asthma-related outcomes (exacerbation rate, lung function-FEV1, IOS-R5-20, and lung inflammation-FeNO), and their links to skin (barrier and immune response) and lung (remodeling, metabolism, aging) pathogenetic pathways.
RNA-Seq captured 1113 in MAA and 2117 DEGs in SAA. Epidermal transcriptomic biomarkers for terminal differentiation (FLG/filaggrin), cell adhesion (CDH19, JAM2), lipid biosynthesis/metabolism (ACOT2, LOXL2) were significantly downregulated. Gene set variation analysis revealed enrichment of Th1/IFNγ pathways (p < .01). MAA and SAA shared downregulation of G-protein-coupled receptor (OR4A16, TAS1R3), upregulation of TGF-β/ErbB signaling-related (ACVR1B, EGFR, ID1/2), and upregulation of mitochondrial-related (HIGD2A, VDAC3, NDUFB9) genes. Skin transcriptomic biomarkers correlated with the annualized exacerbation rate and with lung function parameters. A two-gene classifier (TSSC4-FAM212B) was able to differentiate asthma from HCs with 100% accuracy.

We have searched several public databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, and Relemed and obtained information pertinent to the TSLP, RXR, TSLP blockers, the STAT5-activating cytokines, and IL-33. We discussed the multiple cell signaling mechanisms underlying steroid resistance. Blocking the TSLP and other key signaling molecules like STAT5 can retrieve the sensitivity of natural helper-cells to corticosteroids. RXR derivatives treatment can modulate the activity of TSLP, which further modulates steroid resistance in severe asthmatic patients and in patients with refractory asthma. We discussed the steroid-resistance mediated by the Th2 cells and Th2-driven eosinophilia upon corticosteroid intake.

One of the main cells involved in airway inflammation is eosinophils. In the current study, a bronchial provocation test (BPT) was performed to demonstrate airway hyperresponsiveness. We investigated the relationship between BPT and blood eosinophil count and the cut-off value of blood eosinophil count.
In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the data of 246 patients who visited our immunology and allergy clinic, a tertiary reference center, with asthma symptoms between May 2017 and March 2020 and underwent BPT with methacholine for the diagnosis of asthma. The cases were grouped according to the level of BPT positivity and negativity.
Of 246 patients, BPT was positive in 90 (36.6%) and negative in 156 (63.4%).

Acute and chronic exposure owing to the consumption of non-permitted dyes may lead to health concerns such as allergic reactions, eczema, and asthma. 4-(Dimethylamino)azobenzene (4-DMAAB) is a non-permitted dye that has been reported in adulterated mustard oil. Consumption of 4-DMAAB poses severe risks due to its mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. Several sensitive methods such as FT-NIR, FT-MIR and SERS are available for the detection of 4-DMAAB. Here, a spectrophotometric method was developed for the detection of 4-DMAAB. The developed method was translated to a point-of-test paper-based, chromogenic strip which showed a detection limit of 0.025 mM for 4-DMAAB. Also, an electrochemical sensor was developed by electro-depositing the test solution on a screen-printed electrode. The electrochemical sensor showed an LOD of 0.027 ± 0.008 mM with recovery in the range of 91-107% of 4-DMAAB. Oil samples collected from the market were processed by liquid-liquid extraction and the content of 4-DMAAB was assessed. The developed point-of-use sensors for the detection of 4-DMAAB have potential for use by the consumers, food industry and regulatory agencies for on-site analysis and assuring the quality of edible oils.",,,,38375534,10.1039/d3ay01928d

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of individuals with AF and those considered at high risk for OSA.
A cross-sectional study was conducted with a population comprising patients who had visited KAUH cardiology clinics between 2017-2019; subjects were categorized into AF patients and general cardiology patients. Patients were surveyed for OSA using the Berlin Questionnaire to assess the degree of OSA symptoms and to classify patients into high- or low-risk groups based on their responses.

In this regard, this study aimed to compare the effects of itraconazole and prednisolone (routinely prescribed) on clinical, structural, and biomarker findings of the remodeling of asthma.
This double-blind controlled randomized clinical trial was performed on 70 adult patients suffering from severe persistent asthma. The intervention group received 200 mg of itraconazole per day, and the control group received 10 mg of prednisolone per day, for 32 weeks, in addition to the classic treatment of asthma. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, and assigned by sealed envelope. Blinding was performed by repacking the drug in a similar container. Primary outcomes were asthma control test score, fibroblast growth factor 2, and wall area percentage on RB1 bronchus measured by computed tomography. The outcomes were compared in subjects classified as allergic, eosinophilic, T2 low asthma, and four types of inflammatory cell classification in sputum.
Seventy subjects finished the 32-week trial (35 subjects in each group). Baseline data did not show significant differences between groups. A comparison of asthma variants showed significantly more severe cough and dyspnea in the allergic variant and higher spirometry results in T2-low asthma. Sputum cytology revealed a mixed pattern as the most frequent type (47%). After the trial, two groups improved in many parameters; however, FGF-2 improved more significantly by itraconazole (4.66±16.92 decreased to 1.14±2.98), and FEV1/FVC was significantly higher in the itraconazole group, compared to the control group. These results did not change in terms of asthma variants and sputum classification.

It can mimic other dermatoses; hence making diagnostic challenges for dermatologists. Tina incognita may be misdiagnosed as many dermatoses. Based on previous studies, corticosteroids may cause different clinical manifestations of dermatophytes that might be very different from those that are commonly described.
This narrative review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus databases. Search terms included ""Tinea incognita"" and ""Atypical dermatophytosis"". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, reviews, and case reports. The search was restricted to articles written in the English language from 2006 to Feb 01, 2023. Moreover, duplicate articles and non-available full-text articles were excluded. The extracted data of the search results were retrieved in this study. The morphological patterns, prevalence, sight of infection, and causative agents were also described.
Prevalence of different patterns of TI were recorded as 50% (431 out of 862 cases) for eczema-like lesions followed by psoriasis-like and 6.61% (57 out of 862) for parapsoriasis-like pattern. Moreover, each of the rosacea-like and pyoderma-like lesions equally accounted for 4.98 % of cases (43 out of 862). In addition, the prevalence of causative agents was reported as follows:

Increased group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) have been found in the lungs and peripheral blood of COPD patients, while asthma is associated with elevated levels of ILC2s. However, it is unclear whether the inflammatory characteristics of ILC1s and ILC2s differ between COPD and asthma. This study aims to compare peripheral blood ILC subsets and their expression of inflammatory markers in COPD patients, asthma patients and controls.
The study utilised multi-colour flow cytometry to analyse peripheral blood ILC populations in clinically stable COPD patients (n=38), asthma patients (n=37), and smoking (n=19) and non-smoking (n=16) controls.
Proportions of peripheral blood inflammatory CD4
Our in-depth characterisation of ILC1 and ILC2 populations in peripheral blood revealed significant differences in their phenotypes between COPD and asthma patients and smoking or non-smoking controls. These findings suggest a role for both ILC subsets in COPD disease pathology, independent of smoking history, and may have implications for patient stratification and therapy development.","Our in-depth characterisation of ILC1 and ILC2 populations in peripheral blood revealed significant differences in their phenotypes between COPD and asthma patients and smoking or non-smoking controls.

This study aimed to identify immune-related differentially expressed genes in childhood asthma and establish a classification diagnostic model based on these genes.
GSE65204 and GSE19187 were downloaded and served as training set and validation set. The immune cell composition was evaluated with ssGSEA algorithm based on the immune-related gene set. Modules that significantly related to the asthma were selected by WGCNA algorithm. The immune-related differentially expressed genes (DE-IRGs) were screened, the protein-protein interaction network and diagnostic model of DE-IRGs was constructed. The pathway and immune correlation analysis of hub DE-IRGs was analyzed.
Eight immune cell types exhibited varying levels of abundance between the asthma and control groups. A total of 112 differentially expressed immune-related genes (DE-IRGs) was identified. Through the application of four ranking methods (MCC, MNC, DEGREE, and EPC), 17 hub DE-IRGs with overlapping significance were further selected. Subsequently, 8 optimized were identified using univariate logistic regression analysis and the LASSO regression algorithm, based on which a robust diagnostic model was constructed. Notably, TNF and CD40LG emerged as direct participants in asthma-related signaling pathways, displaying a positive correlation with the immune cell types of immature B cells, activated B cells, activated CD8 T cells, activated CD4 T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.
The diagnostic model constructed using the DE-IRGs (CCL5, CCR5, CD40LG, CD8A, IL2RB, PDCD1, TNF, and ZAP70) exhibited high and specific diagnostic value for childhood asthma. The diagnostic model may contribute to the diagnosis of childhood asthma.","The diagnostic model constructed using the DE-IRGs (CCL5, CCR5, CD40LG, CD8A, IL2RB, PDCD1, TNF, and ZAP70) exhibited high and specific diagnostic value for childhood asthma.

YHD historically utilized as a potent medicinal solution for addressing chronic inflammatory conditions, holds promising therapeutic potential in the treatment of asthma. However, the mechanism underlying JWYHD's effects on allergic asthma remains unclear.
To investigate the therapeutic effects as well as the underlying mechanism of JWYHD on asthmatic mice.
The ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model was utilized, followed by the administration of JWYHD to allergic asthmatic mice. Subsequently, inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were conducted. The levels of various cytokines including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-33, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (IFN)-γ in BALF, as well as the total immunoglobulin E (IgE) content in serum, were assessed. Lung function and tissue pathology examinations were performed to assess the protective impacts of JWYHD. The chemical components of JWYHD and its lung prototype compounds (referred to the chemical components present in JWYHD that were observed in the lung) were explored by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). RNA-seq analysis revealed the regulation mechanism of JWYHD treating asthma. Furthermore, the effects of JWYHD on type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in asthmatic mice was detected by flow cytometry and Smart-RNA-seq analysis. Then molecular docking analysis was used to show the interaction between identified compounds and key targets.
JWYHD significantly attenuated the airway inflammation of asthmatic mice, reduced the levels of inflammatory cells in BALF, as well the levels of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-33, and TNF-α in BALF and IgE in serum. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung inflammation infiltration were also alleviated by JWYHD. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis revealed that JWYHD attenuated airway inflammation in asthmatic mice via regulating immunity. Flow cytometry confirmed that JWYHD could inhibit ILC2 responses. ILC2 Smart-RNA-seq analysis showed that JWYHD impaired the inflammation reaction-related signaling pathways in ILC2s, and neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), endothelial transcription factor 3 (GATA3) and interleukin 1 receptor like protein 1 (ST2) might be the key targets. The molecular docking analysis investigating the connection between the primary targets and JWYHD's prototype compounds in the lung demonstrated that liquiritin apioside, icariin, glycyrrhizic acid, and uralsaponin B, identified through UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, exhibited significant affinity in binding to the mentioned key targets.
Our results suggested that the mechanisms of JWYHD in treating asthma might be related to limiting ILC2 responses. Our findings provided some pharmacological evidence for the clinical application of JWYHD in the treatment of asthma.",Our results suggested that the mechanisms of JWYHD in treating asthma might be related to limiting ILC2 responses.

The presence/absence of 16 TTs was based on pre-defined thresholds. HRQL was assessed with the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Subjects were stratified into two groups, using the median split method, into higher or lower SGRQ total score. Logistic regression assessed the odds ratio (OR) of having a higher SGRQ total score per TT.
Ninety-seven subjects were included, the mean number of TTs per patient was 8.1 ± 2.5. Low physical activity (95%), poor exercise capacity (94%) and severe fatigue (75%) were the most prevalent TTs.
