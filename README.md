# Information 
- What is it ?
- What is it made of ?
- What can be done with it?
- How can it be used optimally to answer questions?
  
This is a repo tries to gradually find more sophisticated answers to those questions, either through code or rambling style posts.

 ## 1. Kants Knowledge Graph
Was a novice investigation transforming philosophical ideas into knowledge graphs.
Thereby two differerent approachs have been used to identfiy entities and relationships.
1. Using Rule based Parsing Systems
2. Using an LLM (Ollama) to extract entities and relationships

Eventually, the results have been visualised using pyvis. As the input size increased, this approach of simply 
visualising all entities and their relationships became unfeasible.
Hence, this project is on hold until I've implemented better solutions.


## 2. TBD
