# Tool for Semantic Document Analysis

In the current version, it aims to extract the acting relationships of subjects in a given text corpus to turn them into knowledgegraphs for further investigations. 
In the future, hopefully, also other relationship types will be covered!

It is currently still in progress. Readme will be updated in the future.
