# Tool for Semantic Document Analysis 

With this tool, I am trying to learn from large data sources as efficiently & quickly as possible.

In the current version, it aims to extract knowledge from a a given (static as well as dynamic) text corpus (large sets of scientific books and papers or web articles from pages like medium) to turn them into knowledge graphs, and enventually, in a tool that helps users to answer questions in a precise, deterministic and correct way.

In addtion, I am currently thinking of turning all new articels/books/papers into a knowledge graph and to add a custom recommendation engine to filter the most relevant new publications for the user(s).

Feel free to contact me if you're interested
